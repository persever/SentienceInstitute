  <html><head><meta content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" http-equiv="content-type"></head><body class="c15"><h2 class="c17"><span>Researche</span><span>r</span></h2><h3 class="c8"><span>Application Deadline: July 31</span><span>, 2020</span></h3><p class="c3"><span>We&#39;re looking for a researcher to work with us on understanding moral circle expansion and related social phenomena, particularly in the contexts of animal ethics or artificial intelligence. This position offers a lot of flexibility with few requirements other than the production of high-quality research that fits within </span><span class="c11"><a class="c10" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/mission">our mission</a></span><span class="c4">. We are open to a variety of social science methods: qualitative (e.g. historical case studies, interviews, conceptual analysis), quantitative (e.g. nationally representative surveys, behavioral experiments, analysis of existing industry and survey data), or mixed methods.</span></p><h3 class="c13" id="h.ulk1nkt866xb"><span class="c7 c2">Research Topics</span></h3><p class="c3"><span>Since founding SI in 2017, we have primarily focused on farmed animals as the current frontier of humanity&#39;s moral circle. We expect our future research on </span><span class="c2">farmed animal</span><span>&nbsp;issues to be similar to our previous research, most of which is listed on </span><span class="c11"><a class="c10" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/research">our Reports page</a></span><span>. We also have some ideas for future research listed in our current </span><span class="c11"><a class="c10" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/research-agenda">research agenda</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;that may be of interest to applicants.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>However, given that our three years of research has grabbed some of the low-hanging fruit on the topic of farmed animals, we are open to candidates with interests in other moral circle expansion topics. The main area we have in mind here is </span><span class="c2">artificial sentience (AS)</span><span>: robots, machines, and other entities made by humans in the future that are able to experience happiness or suffering. For example, SI may run a nationally representative survey of US adults on their attitudes towards artificial sentience and related topics. We are also interested in moral and social issues around </span><span class="c2">artificial intelligence (AI)</span><span>. For example, how can AI systems make appropriate moral decisions when interacting with a wide range of biological and artificial entities?  If you are interested in reading a brief discussion of SI&rsquo;s interest in this area, we have prepared </span><span class="c12"><a class="c10" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kIiGHM0RpGQ-xZtfTLekFutxMKn86nOh0YhNlGA7mGg/edit?usp%3Dsharing">this Google Document</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;for your convenience. Because this is such a new field of research, we expect a lot of the important work to be done will be big-picture surveys and theorizing about the topics.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>In addition to AS and AI, possible research topics include the moral inclusion of </span><span class="c2 c12"><a class="c10" href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/14/9873012/wild-animals-suffering">wild animals</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2">generalizing historical examples</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of moral circle expansion (i.e. analyzing them without a specific current or future expansion in mind, focusing instead on a general understanding of moral inclusion processes).</span></p><h3 class="c13" id="h.huqxeig1d7cz"><span class="c7 c2">Publishing Research Findings</span></h3><p class="c3"><span>While we want all of our research to be thoroughly vetted and publically available, we are open to different publication formats. Our previous publications have been reports (i.e. white papers, working papers), academic journal articles, blog posts, newspaper and magazine articles, conference presentations, and a book. The best publication format depends partly on the content and audience of the work, but we also want to consider how we can support early-career researchers working on the topic of moral circle expansion, and some publication formats may be more useful for their professional development.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">This is, in general, what our researchers work on:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c0 lst-kix_list_1-0 start"><li class="c1"><span class="c4">Collaborate with our small team to decide what projects to pursue</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c4">Conduct that research fairly independently, typically with regular check-ins and peer review prior to publication. Frequent questions and meetings will be expected at the beginning, but should slow down over time as you become more familiar with the research literature and methods.</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c4">Pursue skill development. For example, a qualitatively oriented researcher could take a statistics course online in order to develop some quantitative expertise.</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c4">Provide assistance as needed with other research projects and ideas, mainly by reviewing research for accuracy, clarity, quality of the reasoning, and overlooked evidence</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c4">Since we&rsquo;re a small organization, depending on your individual preferences and abilities, you may also have opportunities to take on other organizational tasks. Examples include administrative and management work, interviews and media commentary, and meeting with and advising organizations who are interested in our research findings.</span></li></ul><h3 class="c13" id="h.zbhuo1c0yluz"><span class="c7 c2">More Information</span></h3><ul class="c0 lst-kix_7ybgggs8b6nm-0 start"><li class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">Employment type:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Full-time (US &quot;at-will&quot; or UK &quot;permanent&quot;); we may consider a contract or half-time role for exceptional candidates.</span></li><li class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">Location:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Remote, US-based (we may be able to make arrangements for international hires, but we are unable to sponsor US visas); current staff are in NYC and London.</span></li><li class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">Experience type:</span><span>&nbsp;Several years of professional or academic social science research</span><span class="c4">. However, we will extend full consideration to applications with less consideration.</span></li><li class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">Start date:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Flexible, sometime around September 2020</span></li><li class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">Work style / Supervision:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Relatively independent with frequent peer feedback</span></li><li class="c3

relevant to their work and engage in other professional development opportunities</span></li><li class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">Job title: </span><span>The exact job title is flexible (e.g.
