  <html><head><meta content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" http-equiv="content-type"></head><body class="c14"><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2020 has been a strange and eventful year for human society. Fortunately our work has proceeded largely without hindrance, but I want to first and foremost extend our sympathy and support to the Sentience Institute community.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Our budget this year has been spent almost entirely on research. </span><span>Now that our operations are fully set up as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization and</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;we employ no administrative staff, and because we have operated as a fully remote team since before COVID-19, we only have a few operational expenses, such as website hosting and postage. We have hit our stride, efficiently publishing the research that we expect will do the most good and sharing that research with the stakeholders who can best make use of it. This includes cultured and plant-based food companies, activist organizations, policymakers, other researchers, individuals choosing their career path, and individuals and foundations choosing where to donate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>While there are a number of research organizations studying the most effective strategies for helping animals, we have carved out a crucial niche with our big-picture, </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/faq#how-does-si-think-about-the-long-term-future?">longtermist</a></span><span>&nbsp;focus</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;on &quot;moral circle expansion.&quot; Our research is aimed not just on helping animals in the next few years, but ensuring that humanity ends factory farming and that after factory farming the moral circle continues to expand to groups such as wild animals and artificial sentient beings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>As always, we are extremely grateful to our supporters who share our vision and make this work possible. If you are able to in 2020, please consider</span><span><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/donate">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/donate">making a donation</a></span><span class="c3">.</span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.cp5mr7xstcv"><span class="c10">Accomplishments in 2020 (To Date)</span></h1><h2 class="c9" id="h.reuyus7ucegm"><span class="c13">Research</span></h2><ul class="c8 lst-kix_m82k7qlde2q-0 start"><li class="c1 c7"><span>We published </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0405-8">Institutional Change and the Limitations of Consumer Activism</a></span><span>&nbsp;in the academic journal </span><span class="c11">Palgrave Communications</span><span class="c3">. We have discussed institutional change at length in our work, arguing that it is usually a more effective strategy than the farmed animal movement&rsquo;s historically heavy focus on individual change. This paper provides a one-stop summary and explication of that argument.</span></li><li class="c1 c7"><span>We published two social movement case studies on the </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/death-penalty">US Anti-Death Penalty Movement</a></span><span>&nbsp;and the </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/prisoners-rights">US Prisoners&#39; Rights Movement</a></span><span>. The circumstances of prisons&rsquo; rights activism require it to be primarily ally-based, more similar to animal advocacy than most social movements, which are victim-based. The reports provide evidence</span><span>&nbsp;that a narrow focus on legal strategies discourages the growth of a grassroots movement and makes a movement more fragile, that legislative change is possible without public support, and that incremental improvements can discourage fundamental improvements.</span></li><li class="c1 c7"><span>We published our first experiment on </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/afft-experiment">The Effects of Animal-Free Food Technology Awareness on Animal Farming Opposition</a></span><span>. </span><span>We found that, holding certain factors equal, telling people about plant-based and cultured meat reduces opposition to animal farming. While this does not mean we should avoid extolling the benefits of vegan food, it suggests caution in how we do so.</span></li><li class="c1 c7"><span>We published our first literature review, an extremely thorough and expansive project on </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/health-behavior">Health Behavior Interventions</a></span><span class="c3">. This includes a wide range of insights from the huge literature on health behavior, which can be implied to a variety of strategic dilemmas in encouraging people to eat fewer animal products.</span></li><li class="c1 c7"><span>We updated our </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/foundational-questions-summaries">Foundational Questions Summaries</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/research-agenda">Research Agenda</a></span><span>.</span></li></ul><h3 class="c4" id="h.t2hxzc83rj5a"><span>In</span><span class="c15">-Progress Research to be Published in Coming Months</span></h3><p class="c1"><span>More detail on our in-progress research is available in our </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/research-agenda">Research Agenda</a></span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c8 lst-kix_fhe2w8agwjtj-0 start"><li class="c1 c7"><span>Two chapters in a textbook on cellular agriculture. </span><span class="c11">(In-press.

The marginal funding that enables us to make a new hire is generally around $55,000.</span><span>&nbsp;In each of our previous hiring rounds, we had multiple excellent research candidates, so we are confident we can continue to make outstanding research hires. In fact, in our 2020 hiring round, we had 123 applications, far more than previous rounds. Of those applicants, there were at least seven whom we would have been very happy to hire, including the one we did hire. Take a look at our </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/research-agenda">agenda</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;for an idea of the research that we could conduct with new staff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We currently have a solid runway for our existing staff. We aim to raise $90,000 by the end of this year to enable us to make a new research hire. If we raise above that amount, we expect that we can continue spending it in similarly cost-effective ways up to at least $180,000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>If you are uncertain whether to make a donation to Sentience Institute, please feel free to email me at </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="mailto:jacy@sentienceinstitute.org">jacy@sentienceinstitute.org</a></span><span>.
