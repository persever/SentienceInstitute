A couple of studies have made some attempt to do so: </span><span class="c2"><a class="c4" href="http://www.davidgamez.eu/papers/Gamez05_OrdinalProbabilityScale.pdf">Gamez (2005)</a></span><span class="c6">&nbsp;proposed a list of eight features for assessing consciousness in artificial entities, where the features were chosen so that artificial entities with more human-like capacities are more likely to be considered conscious,</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2"><a class="c4" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00025/full">Pennartz et al. (2019)</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;considered how features indicative of consciousness in nonhuman animals can be applied to artificial entities. Overall, therefore, we think this approach can be usefully applied to the case of artificial entities, but there are several differences from the application to nonhuman animals that need to be considered.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">First, when it comes to identifying features associated with sentience in nonhuman animals it is typical to focus on biology. For example, the studies described in the previous section propose neuroanatomical features, such as the absence or presence of nociceptive cells or certain brain structures, and physiological features, such as the production of and response to analgesics. Clearly, these features are not appropriate in the case of artificial entities. Instead, we should focus on analogous features at the functional and algorithmic levels. For example, rather than the presence of physical nociceptors, we should consider the ability to detect harmful stimuli. This shift to focusing on functional and algorithmic rather than biological features requires us to assume that these higher levels are appropriate levels of analysis for understanding sentience, and that sentience can be realized in multiple substrates, not just biological ones.</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;It may also be important to take into account the physical structure of artificial entities, which is important on some theories of consciousness.</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Another common strategy to assess sentience in nonhuman animals is to refer to its evolved function. For example, it </span><span class="c2"><a class="c4" href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2019.0290">is argued</a></span><span class="c6">&nbsp;that pain serves the function of encouraging animals to avoid harmful stimuli, which in turn increases their chances of survival and reproduction, and therefore animals likely experience pain. This type of reasoning will generally be less reliable for artificial entities insofar as evolutionary selection is less influential in their development.</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;At the extreme, artificial entities could be designed in an entirely ad hoc way, for example, with the capacity to experience pain that serves no function, and without the capacity to avoid that pain. We should also extrapolate from evolved behaviors, such as vocalizing pain, with caution, since they may not be relevant to artificial entities.</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">A third consideration is that the presence of higher-order capacities in artificial entities, such as </span><span class="c2"><a class="c4" href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.167.3914.86">self-recognition</a></span><span class="c6">, are not as strong evidence of sentience as in animals, where they are sometimes considered to be </span><span class="c2"><a class="c4" href="https://reducing-suffering.org/which-computations-do-i-care-about/#Criterion_of_Conscious_Feeling">sufficient conditions</a></span><span class="c6">. This is because artificial entities </span><span class="c2"><a class="c4" href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">can be designed</a></span><span class="c6">&nbsp;to have very strong capabilities on some dimensions but very limited capabilities on others, whereas in animals higher-order capacities tend to be built upon more basic ones. Relatedly, artificial entities can be designed to superficially meet some features but still be unlikely to be sentient. For example, while </span><span class="c2"><a class="c4" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.22">verbal reports</a></span><span class="c6">&nbsp;are typically considered to be strong evidence of consciousness, engineers could easily design a robot that plays a recording of the phrase &ldquo;</span><span class="c2"><a class="c4" href="https://reducing-suffering.org/consciousness-is-a-process-not-a-moment/#What_is_pain">I&rsquo;m in pain!</a></span><span class="c6">&rdquo; if it is dropped. On its own, we wouldn&rsquo;t want to take this &ldquo;verbal report&rdquo; as evidence that the robot is sentient. As </span><span class="c2"><a class="c4" href="https://reducing-suffering.org/which-computations-do-i-care-about/">Tomasik (2013)</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;argues, to be judged as sentient it may be that we require an entity to satisfy a range of criteria in a non-superficial way, and it may also be that the types of algorithms the entity runs to produce behavior are important in addition to the behavior itself.</span></p><h1 class="c11" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c9 c6">Relevant features</span></h1><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Taking into account the considerations described in the previous section, we can propose features that may be associated with sentience in artificial entities. Given the current lack of scientific consensus on how sentience works, especially its experiential aspect, we do not think it is possible to have a great deal of confidence in a core set of features. We instead propose, in line with </span><span class="c2"><a class="c4" href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/2017-report-consciousness-and-moral-patienthood">Muehlhauser (2017)</a></span><span class="c6">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2"><a class="c4" href="https://www.rethinkpriorities.org/blog/2019/6/7/invertebrate-sentience-a-useful-empirical-resource">Rethink Priorities (2019)</a></span><span class="c0">, that a relatively large number of features consistent with a range of plausible theories are considered.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">For example, we propose features in the table that cover both theories that emphasize attention and theories that emphasize integration of information. That is not to say we endorse either of these theories, or any other specific theory referred to in the table of features. Nor do we think that we need evidence that an entity needs to satisfy all (or even most) of the criteria in the table to be considered sentient. Rather, we think that an entity that satisfies more of the criteria more strongly warrants the attribution of sentience than an entity that satisfies fewer. In the next section we outline a method for making judgments about sentience based on the features in Table 1.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">The features we propose capture two general categories. First are features more related to valenced states, such as the detection of harmful stimuli. Second are features related to an entity&rsquo;s general capacity for experience, such as centralized information processing.</span><sup class="c6 c7"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Some features, such as attention directed on the source of harmful stimuli, capture both an entity&rsquo;s capacity for experience and to be in a valenced state, and therefore fall under both categories.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Note that the features listed in Table 1 are not exhaustive, precise, or distinct. We have considered several of the most prominent theories relevant to sentience, but there are many theories that we have not considered. We have also focused at this point on negatively valenced states, but we note that positively valenced states may also be relevant.

What will be their moral statuses and capacities for welfare? How many of these entities will exist? Under what scenarios will they have positive and negative welfare, and how likely are these scenarios to be realized? Are there any interventions we can carry out that will improve their welfare? We intend to explore these questions in future posts.</span></p><hr class="c22"><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt1">[1]</a><span class="c6 c17">&nbsp;Arguably, this problem is compounded by the </span><span class="c2 c20"><a class="c4" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/other-minds/">problem of other minds</a></span><span class="c16 c6">, and applies to all entities, not just artificial ones.
