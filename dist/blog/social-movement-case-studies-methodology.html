Making use of existing literature is a much quicker route to assessing the strategic implications of a historical moment than conducting original historical research, so SI&rsquo;s historical research relies mostly on secondary sources from historians and social scientists, though it turns to primary sources when necessary to fill gaps.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup></p><h1 class="c12" id="h.yjzje5yjnwtz"><span>Overarching goals</span><span class="c15">, caveats, and foci of the reports</span></h1><h2 class="c5" id="h.f3rvqvt3zvqs"><span class="c21">Focus on strategy, not moral assessment</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Our case studies focus on movements with a wide variety of aims that we do not always endorse. We make no attempt to morally evaluate the goals of the studied movements. The reports are exclusively about the strategy of social movements, and while we will discuss goals insofar as they are relevant to strategic discussion, we deliberately avoid any moral assessment. We hope readers will keep an open mind and attempt to examine the strategy of the studied movements with an objective lens, even if they disagree with the goals of those movements.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span>Our focus on strategy is highlighted in the &ldquo;strategic implications&rdquo; sections of our case studies.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.isbr1mk7s4fg"><span class="c21">Gathering evidence for many questions</span></h2><p class="c10"><span>We approach our case studies with hypotheses in mind, such as the claims listed on our &ldquo;</span><span class="c17"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/foundational-questions-summaries">Summary of Evidence for Foundational Questions in Effective Animal Advocacy</a></span><span>&rdquo; page. For example, we might pay particularly close attention to the effects of incremental institutional tactics, to test our hypothesis that </span><span class="c17"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/foundational-questions-summaries#momentum-vs.-complacency-from-welfare-reforms">animal welfare reforms lead to more momentum than complacency for future progress</a></span><span>. We also use our case studies to test tentative hypotheses on a variety of more specific or less important strategic questions, informed by our previous research.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Given the large number of questions of interest addressed by the case studies, we do not formally expound our hypotheses.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span>More broadly, one benefit of case studies is that they enable identification of topics of potential importance that we had not previously considered. Hence, our reports are also undertaken as exploratory research.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.jhcbo4d6uw2t"><span>Focus on causation when feasible</span><sup><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c0">The decisions we need to make in modern social movements are causal: If we have to choose between one strategy and another, which is more likely to succeed? All SI social movement research is therefore ultimately interested in assessing causation. This is particularly important for the &ldquo;strategic implications&rdquo; sections of our case studies.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Where there are several factors plausibly causing a specific outcome, our reports so far do not usually attempt to rigorously evaluate the individual effects of these different factors. This is partly because investigating the relevant evidence would be time-consuming (e.g. seeking out primary sources that might contain relevant information) and partly because such a task is usually impossible to achieve with much confidence (e.g. due to the impossibility of running experiments to explore counterfactuals). In other words, we have focused on establishing the likely presence of causal factors, rather than their exact contribution to the overall causal chain of events.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.bpichkaybzpo"><span class="c21">Identifying implications for many movements</span></h2><p class="c10"><span>Our analysis often highlights the farmed animal movement as an illustrative example of the strategic implications for a variety of movements. </span><span>Our research to date has focused on farmed animals</span><span class="c0">, so this is the area where we have most expertise and the largest audience. Nevertheless, our comparisons to the farmed animal movement tend to be brief for several reasons:</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_uk5mitoza1r2-0 start"><li class="c10 c19 li-bullet-0"><span>We would like to keep the reports as concise as possible, without compromising the rigor of the research. </span><span>Often the same substance can be conveyed either as an implication for farmed animal advocacy or general advocacy</span><span>.</span></li><li class="c10 c19 li-bullet-0"><span>We believe that a number of different movements can benefit from our social movement case studies, including the nascent movements to protect the interests of future sentient beings (e.g. </span><span class="c17"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/the-importance-of-artificial-sentience">artificial sentience</a></span><span>); extensive comparison to the farmed animal movement is not helpful for readers most interested in these movements.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup></li><li class="c10 c19 li-bullet-0"><span>We expect a narrower focus on the studied movements to be more conducive to academic engagement with our work, given academics</span><span>&nbsp;(i.e. researchers at universities) </span><span class="c0">focus on generalizations across many movements. </span></li></ul><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span>When we draw comparison to the farmed animal movement, our descriptions tend to be weighted towards the Western and particularly the US movement, where we have most familiarity and where the most resources are spent,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;so readers from other regions may see different similarities and differences between the studied movements and their own region and movement. They should adjust the applicability of the reports&rsquo; conclusions to their own region&rsquo;s advocacy accordingly. For brevity, we assume that the reader has some knowledge of modern animal farming and animal advocacy.</span></p><h1 class="c12" id="h.4pmv5mm7it50"><span class="c15">Goals and caveats of specific sections of the reports</span></h1><h2 class="c5" id="h.jtifdbj2wjiy"><span class="c21">Strategic implications</span></h2><p class="c10"><span>Each report discusses a number of strategic claims supported by the included evidence. There are many challenges in integrating evidence from historical social movements into modern advocacy decision-making,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and one&rsquo;s view of the strength of the listed claims should depend on all available evidence, not just the evidence provided by the case study itself. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span>Hence, just because a strategic implication is listed in a particular case study does not necessarily mean that the strategic implication holds after all the available evidence is considered. The inclusion of strategic implications that we may currently disagree with is consistent with the principles of </span><span class="c17"><a class="c2" href="https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/content/what-open-science-introduction">open science</a></span><span>; it could be </span><span class="c17"><a class="c2" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3341407/">misleading</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to publish only those conclusions that support our prior beliefs and to omit others, and it would be inefficient to evaluate all available evidence (e.g. from all case studies) for every claim in each individual case study.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.jniups78tc8"><span>Condensed chronological history</span></h2><p class="c10"><span>Each case study includes a condensed chronological history. Unless it seems especially important for understanding the context and chain of events, we tend to avoid discussing causation in the condensed chronological history section. This follows the common scientific practice of separating empirical results and raw &ldquo;facts&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;from discussion and analysis, but is </span><span class="c17"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/how-is-SI-research-different#format">notably different</a></span><span>&nbsp;from many studies by historians and sociologists, where causal relationships are sometimes implied within the </span><span class="c17"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/how-is-SI-research-different#format">narrative</a></span><span>&nbsp;of events </span><span class="c17"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/how-is-SI-research-different#consideration-of-causation">without explicit evaluation</a></span><span>. Presenting this chronology separately from our analysis allows readers discretion to focus on findings relevant to their purposes, such as information with strategic implications for their own region.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Additionally, providing this detail allows for greater scrutiny of our analysis, by clearly listing the evidence that supports each claim.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Importantly, the condensed history is not intended to imply causal relationships between listed events, unless stated explicitly. For example, if a sentence referring to a change in the legal context is followed by a sentence about changes in individual behavior, the two should not be assumed to be connected.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">The report is not intended to present a comprehensive narrative; it condenses the history into events and processes that have strategic implications for modern social movements. There are slight deviations from chronological order used for clarity, e.g. to group together evidence relating to similar topics within a short period of time.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.75huqv2x84fg"><span class="c21">The extent of success</span></h2><p class="c10"><span>If a tactic, campaign, or movement was successful, then advocates should usually be more likely to use those strategies, and less likely to use them if they failed. Where judgments of causation regarding specific </span><span>tactic</span><span>&nbsp;or campaign outcomes are uncertain, a case study can still be informative: if a particular social movement successfully achieves its goals, then this provides weak evidence that its particular characteristics (such as the tactics used and prioritized) led to success. If it fails to achieve its goals, then this provides weak evidence that its particular characteristics led to failure. The noting of such correlations between certain characteristics and success or failure will become more useful as we analyze a greater number of historical social movements and note whether any correlations reliably replicate across different movements and across different contexts.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span>Changes in behavior, legislation, and legal precedent are most directly related to improvements for the intended beneficiaries of a social movement.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;From a longer-term perspective of moral circle expansion, it is also important to consider whether a movement has been able to secure less concrete forms of success, such as changes to values, culture, and identity. In this sense, measures of public opinion and qualitative information about the acceptance of a movement and its goals by its audience or institutional decision makers are also informative.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.eb2yffb39vuy"><span>Movement features</span></h2><p class="c10"><span>As noted in the section &ldquo;Case study selection,&rdquo; the more similar the context and content of two movements, the more we should expect what worked for one movement to work for another. The &ldquo;Features&rdquo; sections of our reports enable the reader to assess for themselves how similar the studied movement is to the movement(s) that they are most interested in. In our </span><span class="c17"><a class="c2" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/british-antislavery#similarities-between-the-british-antislavery-movement-and-the-modern-anti-animal-farming-movement">first case study</a></span><span class="c0">, these movement features were expressed as similarities or differences to the farmed animal movement, though, as noted above, we now focus only on brief comparison to the farmed animal movement.</span></p><div><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p></div><hr class="c29"><div><p class="c8 c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt1">[1]</a><span class="c11">&nbsp;At times, this post uses text from previous SI reports and blog posts; such comments are not cited directly.
