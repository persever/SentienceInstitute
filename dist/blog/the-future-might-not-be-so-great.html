T</span><span>here may be substantial overlap with extinction risk reduction approaches, but in this case and in general, much more research is needed.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>I think that the effective altruism (EA) emphasis on existential risk could be replaced by a mindset of </span><span>cautious longtermism:</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Before humanity colonizes the universe, we must ensure that the future we would build is one worth living in.</span></p><p class="c11"><span>I have spoken to many </span><span>longtermist</span><span>&nbsp;EAs about this </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/crucial-consideration">crucial consideration</a></span><span>, and f</span><span>or most of them, that was their first time explicitly considering the EV of human expansion.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;</span><span>My sense is that many more are considering it now,</span><span>&nbsp;and the community is growing more skeptical of </span><span>highly positive EV</span><span>&nbsp;as the correct estimate.</span><span>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m eager to hear more people&rsquo;s thoughts on the all-things-considered estimate of EV, and I discuss the limited work done on this topic to date in the </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="#h.onh7u8risudz">&ldquo;Related Work&rdquo;</a></span><span>&nbsp;section.</span></p><p class="c11"><span>In the following table, I lay out the object-level arguments on the EV of human expansion, and the rest of the essay details meta-considerations (e.g., option value). The table also includes the strongest supporting arguments that increase the evidential weight of their corresponding argument and the strongest counterarguments that reduce the weight. </span><span>The arguments are not mutually exclusive and are merely intended as broad categories that reflect the most common and compelling arguments for at least some people (not necessarily me) on this topic. For example, </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="#h.i8jadqryh40t">Historical Progress</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="#h.5baytopn0b3n">Value Through Intent</a></span><span>&nbsp;have been intertwined insofar as </span><span>human</span><span>s intentionally create progress, so users of this table should be mindful that they do not overcount (e.g., double count) the same evidence. I handle this in my own thinking by splitting an overlapping piece of evidence among </span><span>its</span><span>&nbsp;categories in proportion to a rough sense of fit in those categories.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup></p><p class="c11"><span>In the </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t-OM6eh_XBMUierl7nhSJ7LcjnRmU3ACyMWk5E_PKXs">associated spreadsheet</a></span><span>, I list my own subjective evidential weight scores where positive numbers indicate evidence for +EV and negative numbers indicate evidence for -EV. I</span><span>t is helpful to think through these arguments with d</span><span>ifferent assignment and aggregation methods, such as linear or logarithmic scaling.</span><span>&nbsp;W</span><span>ith different methodologies to aggregate my own estimates or those of others, the total estimate is highly negative around </span><span>30% of the time, weakly negative 40%, and weakly positive 30%</span><span>. It is almost never highly positive.</span><span>&nbsp;I encourage people to make their own estimates, and all such estimates should be taken with golf balls of salt.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup></p><p class="c11"><span>T</span><span>his is an atypical structure for an argumentative essay&mdash;laying out all the arguments, for and against, instead of laying out arguments for my position and rebutting the objections. </span><span>I think that we should detach argumentation from evaluation.</span><span>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not aiming for maximum persuasiveness. Indeed, the thrust of my critique is that EAs have failed to consider these arguments in such a systematic way, either neglecting the assumption entirely or selecting only a handful of the multitude of evidence and reason we have available.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Overall, my current thinking (primarily an average of several aggregations of quantified estimates and </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aumann%2527s_agreement_theorem">Aumann</a></span><span>&nbsp;updating on others&rsquo; views) is that the EV of human expansion is not highly positive.

The argument that option value is good because our d</span><span>escendants will use it well is circular</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;because the case against extinction risk reduction is primarily focused on humanity not using its options well (i.e., humanity not using its options well is both the premise and the conclusion). An argument that relies on the claim that is being contested is very limited. However, we have more control if one thinks extinction timelines are very short and, if one survives, they and their colleagues will have substantial control over humanity&rsquo;s actions; we also may be optimistic about human action despite being pessimistic about the future if we think nonhuman forces such as aliens and evolution are the decisive drivers of long-term disvalue.</span></p><p class="c11"><span>Second, continued human existence very plausibly limits option value in similar ways to nonexistence. </span><span>Whether we are in a time of perils or not, there is no easy &ldquo;off switch&rdquo; for which humanity can decide to let itself go extinct, especially with advanced technologies (e.g., spreading out through </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft">von Neumann probes</a></span><span>).</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>It is not as if we can or should reduce extinction risk in the 2020s then easily raise it in the 2030s based on further global priorities research.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Still, there is a greater variety of non-extinct than extinct civilizations, so insofar as we want to preserve a wide future of possibilities, that is reason to favor extinction risk reduction.</span></p><p class="c11"><span>Instead of option value, the more important considerations to me are (i) that we have other promising options with high EV such that extinction risk reduction needs to be more positive than these other options in order to justify prioritization and (ii) t</span><span>hat we should have some risk aversion and sandboxing of EV estimates such that we should sometimes treat close-to-zero values as zero.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s also unclear how to weigh the totality of evidence here, but insofar as it is weak and speculative&mdash;as with most questions about the long-term future&mdash;one may pull their estimate towards a prior, though it is unclear what that prior should be. If one thinks zero is a particularly common answer in an appropriate reference class, that could be reasonable, but it depends on many factors beyond the scope of this essay.</span></p><h1 class="c31 c23 c15" id="h.4jjftlhxeg3m"><span class="c26 c5">Time-Sensitivity</span></h1><p class="c11"><span>If we are allocating resources to both population and quality risks, one could argue that we should spend resources on population risks first because the quality of individual lives only matters insofar as those individuals exist. T</span><span>he opposite is true as well: </span><span>For example, if a quality of zero were locked in for the long-term future, then increasing or decreasing the population would have no moral value or disvalue.

Two related EA Forum posts are </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/225Aq4P4jFPoWBrb5/cause-prioritization-for-downside-focused-value-systems">&ldquo;Cause Prioritization for Downside-Focused Value Systems&rdquo; (Gloor 2018)</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LpkXtFXdsRd4rG8Kb/reducing-long-term-risks-from-malevolent-actors">&ldquo;Reducing Long-Term Risks from Malevolent Actors&rdquo; (Althaus and Baumann 2020)</a></span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;Additionally, at this early stage of the </span><span>longtermist</span><span>&nbsp;movement, the top priorities for population and quality risk may largely intersect. Both issues suggest foundational research of topics such as the nature of AI control and likely trajectories of the long-term future, community-building of thoughtful do-gooders, and field-building of institutional infrastructure to use for steering the long-term future.</span></p><h2 class="c23 c15 c33" id="h.2a4ch4j91e26"><span class="c5 c21">Importance</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c2">One important application of the EV of human expansion is to the &ldquo;importance&rdquo; of population and quality risks. Importance can be operationalized as the good done if the entire cause succeeded in solving its corresponding problem, such as the good done by eliminating or substantially reducing extinction risk, which is effectively zero if the EV of human expansion is zero and effectively negative if the EV of human expansion is negative.</span></p><p class="c11"><span>The importance of quality risk reduction is clearer, in the sense that the difference in quality between possible futures is clearer than the difference in extinction and non-extinction, and larger,</span><span>&nbsp; in the sense that while population risk entails only the range of zero-to-positive difference between human extinction and non-extinction (or population risk between zero population and some positive number of individuals) across quality risk entails the difference between the best quality humans could engender and the worst, across all possible population sizes. </span><span>This is arguably a weakness of the framework because we could categorize the quality risk cause area as smaller in importance (say, an increase of 1 trillion utils, i.e., units of goodness), and it would tend to become more tractable as we narrow the category.</span></p><h2 class="c33 c23 c15" id="h.vnskdt9lbf5g"><span class="c21 c5">Tractability</span></h2><p class="c11"><span>The tractability difference </span><span>between population and quality risk </span><span>seems the least clear of the three criteria</span><span>. My general approach is thinking through the most likely </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/theory-of-change">&ldquo;theories of change&rdquo;</a></span><span>&nbsp;or paths to impact and assessing them step-by-step. For example, one commonly discussed extinction risk reduction path to impact is </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/tag/agent-foundations">&ldquo;agent foundations,&rdquo;</a></span><span>&nbsp;building mathematical frameworks and formally proving claims about the behavior of intelligent agents, which would then allow us to build advanced AI systems more likely to do what we tell them to do, and then using these frameworks to build AGI or persuading the builders of AGI to use them. Quality-risk-focused AI safety strategies may be more focused on the </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/tag/outer-alignment">outer alignment</a></span><span>&nbsp;problem, ensuring that an AI&rsquo;s objective is aligned with the right values</span><span>, rather than just the </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/tag/inner-alignment">inner alignment</a></span><span>&nbsp;problem, ensuring that all actions of the AI are aligned with the objective</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;Also, we can influence quality by steering the &ldquo;direction&rdquo; or &ldquo;speed&rdquo; of the long-term future, approaches with potentially very different impact, hinging on factors such as the distribution of likely futures across value and likelihood (e.g., </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DNTV81NZSuKw">Anthis 2018c</a></span><span>; </span><span class="c0 c5"><a class="c1" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2021.102756">Anthis and Paez 2021</a></span><span>)</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c11"><span>One argument that I often hear on the tractability of trajectory changes is that changes need to &ldquo;stick&rdquo; or &ldquo;persist&rdquo; over long periods.</span><span>&nbsp;It is true that there needs to be a persistent change in the expected value (i.e., the </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable">random variable</a></span><span>&nbsp;or time series </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304407690900939">regime</a></span><span>&nbsp;of value in the future), but I frequently hear the claim that there needs to be a persistent change in the </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realization_(probability)">realization</a></span><span>&nbsp;of that value.</span><span>&nbsp;For example, if we successfully broker a peace deal between great powers, </span><span>neither the peace deal itself nor any other particular change in the world has to persist in order for this to have high long-term impact.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The series of values itself can have arbitrarily large variance, such as it being very likely that the peace deal is broken within a decade.</span></p><p class="c11"><span>For a sort of change to be intractable, it needs to not just lack persistence, but </span><span>to rubber band (i.e., create opposite-sign effects) back to its counterfactual</span><span>.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For example, if brokering a peace deal causes an equal and opposite reaction of anti-peace efforts, then that trajectory change is intractable. Moreover, we should not only consider rubber banding but dominoing (i.e., create same-sign effects), perhaps because of how this peace deal inspires other great powers to follow suit even if this particular deal is broken. There is much of this potential energy in the world waiting to be unlocked by thoughtful actors.</span></p><p class="c11"><span>The tractability of trajectory change has been the subject of research at Sentience Institute, including our </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="http://sentienceinstitute.org/research">historical case studies</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/how-tractable-is-changing-the-course-of-history">&ldquo;Harris&rsquo; (2019)&rdquo; How Tractable Is Changing the Course of History?&rdquo;</a></span></p><h2 class="c33 c23 c15" id="h.tyn83i5szzbh"><span class="c21 c5">Neglectedness</span></h2><p class="c11"><span>The neglectedness difference between population and quality risk seems the most clear. </span><span>There are far more EAs and longtermists working explicitly on population risks than on quality risks</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(i.e., risks to the moral value of individuals in the long-term future). Two nuances for this claim are first that it may not be true for other relevant comparisons: For example, many people in the world are trying to change social institutions, such as different sides of the political spectrum trying to pull public opinion towards their end of the spectrum. This group seems much larger than people focused explicitly on extinction risks, and there are many other relevant reference classes. Second, it is not entirely clear whether extinction risk reduction and quality risk reduction face higher or lower returns to being less neglected (i.e., more crowded). It may be that so few people are focused on quality risks that marginal returns are actually lower than they would be if there were more people working on them (i.e., increasing returns).</span></p><h1 class="c31 c23 c15" id="h.ljn5h87knqaj"><span class="c26 c5">Future Research on the EV of Human Expansion</span></h1><p class="c11"><span>Because most events in the long-term future entail some sort of value or disvalue, most new information from </span><span>longtermist</span><span>&nbsp;research provides some evidence on the EV of human expansion. As stated above, I&rsquo;m particularly excited about cooperative game theory research (e.g., </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/center-on-long-term-risk">CLR</a></span><span>, </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/center-for-human-compatible-artificial-intelligence">CHAI</a></span><span>), moral circle expansion and digital minds research (e.g., </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/sentience-institute">SI</a></span><span>, </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/future-of-humanity-institute">FHI</a></span><span>), and exploration of concrete trajectories </span><span class="c5">(e.g., </span><span class="c0 c5"><a class="c1" href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780198754626.001.0001/isbn-9780198754626">Hanson 2016</a></span><span class="c5">; </span><span class="c0 c5"><a class="c1" href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/FDJnZt8Ks2djouQTZ/how-do-we-become-confident-in-the-safety-of-a-machine">Hubinger 2021</a></span><span class="c5">)</span><span>. I&rsquo;m</span><span>&nbsp;relatively less excited (though still excited!), on the margin, by entirely armchair taxonomization and argumentation like that in this essay. That includes research on axiological asymmetries, such as more debate on </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/suffering-focused-ethics">suffering-focused ethics</a></span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/population-ethics">population ethics</a></span><span class="c2">, though these can be more useful for other topics and perhaps other people considering this question. My lack of enthusiasm is largely because in the past 8 years of having this view that the EV of human expansion is not highly positive, very little of the new evidence has come from armchair reasoning and argumentation, despite that being more common (although what sort of research is most common depends on where one draws the boundaries because, again, so much research has implications for EV).</span></p><p class="c11"><span>In general, this is such an encompassing, big-picture topic that empirical data is extremely limited relative to scope, and it seems necessary to rely on qualitative intuitions, quantitative intuitions, or back-of-the-envelope calculations a la </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fogJKYXvqzkr9KCud/a-complete-quantitative-model-for-cause-selection">Dickens&rsquo; (2016) &ldquo;A Complete Quantitative Model for Cause Selection&rdquo;</a></span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/Tarsney-Epistemic-Challenge-to-Longtermism.pdf">Tarsney&rsquo;s (2022) &ldquo;The Epistemic Challenge to Longtermism.&rdquo;</a></span><span>&nbsp;I would like to see a more systematic survey of such intuitions, ideally from 5-30 people who have read through this essay and the </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="#h.onh7u8risudz">&ldquo;Related Work.&rdquo;</a></span><span>&nbsp;Ideally these would be stated as credible intervals or similar probability distributions, such that we can more easily quantify uncertainty in the overall estimate. As with all topics, I think we should </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aumann%2527s_agreement_theorem">Aumann</a></span><span>&nbsp;update on each other&rsquo;s views, a process in which I split the difference between my belief and someone else&rsquo;s even if I do not know all the prior and posterior evidence on which they base their view. Of course, this is messy in the real world, for instance because we presumably should account not just for the few people with whom we happen to know their beliefs, but also for our expectations of the many people who also have a belief and even hypothetical people who could have a belief (e.g., unbiased versions of real-world people). It is also unclear whether normative (e.g., moral) views constitute the sort of belief that should be updated in this way, such as between people with fundamentally different value trade-offs between happiness and suffering.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;There are </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/moral-cooperation">cooperative reasons</a></span><span>&nbsp;to deeply account for others&rsquo;

For example, it can include subjective goods (valuable for a person) and objective goods (valuable regardless of people), and it can be understood as estimates or direct observation of realist good (stance-independent) or anti-realist good (stance-dependent). Some may also have moral aims aside from maximizing expected &ldquo;value&rdquo; per se, at least for certain senses of &ldquo;expected&rdquo; and &ldquo;value.&rdquo; There is a substantial philosophical literature on such topics that I will not wade into, and I believe such non-value-based arguments can be mapped onto value-based arguments with minimal loss (e.g., not having a duty to make happy people can be mapped onto there being no value in making happy people). In general, I will try to keep this blog post modular and at most briefly summarize extant literature.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8 c23"><a href="#ftnt_ref2" id="ftnt2">[2]</a><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Both population risks and quality risks can be </span><span class="c0 c12"><a class="c1" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/existential-risk">existential risks</a></span><span>&mdash;though </span><span>longtermist</span><span>&nbsp;EAs have usually defaulted to a focus on population risks, particularly extinction risks.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8 c23"><a href="#ftnt_ref3" id="ftnt3">[3]</a><span class="c38">&nbsp;</span><span>For the sake of brevity, I analyze human survival and interstellar colonization together under the label &ldquo;human expansion.&rdquo; I gloss over possible futures in which humanity survives but does not </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/space-colonization">colonize space</a></span><span>.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8 c23"><a href="#ftnt_ref4" id="ftnt4">[4]</a><span>&nbsp;For example, t</span><span>he portion of historical progress made through market mechanisms is split among </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="#h.i8jadqryh40t">Historical Progress</a></span><span>&nbsp;insofar as this is a large historical trend, </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="#h.5baytopn0b3n">Value Through Intent</a></span><span>&nbsp;insofar as humans intentionally progressed in this way, </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="#h.i5hbkkxggbpk">Value Through Evolution</a></span><span>&nbsp;insofar as selection increased the prevalence of these mechanisms, and </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="#h.hufvw453drm2">Reasoned Cooperation</a></span><span>&nbsp;insofar as the intentional change was through reasoned cooperation</span><span>. How is this splitting calculated? I punt to future work, but in general, I mean some sort of causal attribution measure. For example, if I grow an apple tree that is caused by both rain and soil nutrients, then I would assign more causal force to rain if and only if reducing rain by one standard deviation would inhibit growth more than reducing soil nutrients by one standard deviation.

There are many approaches we could take to aggregating such evidence, reasoning, and intuitions; we could entirely avoid quantification entirely and take the gestalt of these arguments. If taken as logarithms of 2 (e.g., take 0 as 0, take 1 as 2, take 10 as 2^10=1024) as the prior that EA arguments tend to vary in weight by doubling rather than linear scaling, then the mean is </span><span>-410</span><span>. Again, these are just two of the many possible ways to aggregate arguments on this topic. Also, for methodological clarity at the risk of droning, I assign weights constantly across arguments (e.g., 2 arguments of weight +2 are the same evidential weight as 4 arguments of weight +1), though other assignment methods are reasonable, and again, other divisions of the arguments (i.e., other numbers of rows in the table) are reasonable and would make no difference in my own additive total, though they could change the exponential total and other aggregations.</span></p></div><div><p class="c8 c23"><a href="#ftnt_ref7" id="ftnt7">[7]</a><span>&nbsp;In my opinion, there are many different values involved in developing and deploying an AI system, so the distinction between </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/tag/inner-alignment">inner</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/tag/outer-alignment">outer</a></span><span>&nbsp;alignment is rarely precise in practice. Much of identifying and aligning with &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;correct&rdquo; values can be described as outer alignment. In general, I think of AI value alignment as a long series of mechanisms from the causal factors that create human values (which themselves can be thought of as objective functions) to a tangled web of objectives in each human brain (e.g., values, desires, preferences) to a tangled web of social objectives aggregated across humans (e.g., voting, debates, parliaments, marketplaces) to a tangled web of objectives communicated from humans to machines (e.g., material values in game-playing AI, training data, training labels, architectures) to a tangled web of emergent objectives in the machines (e.g., parametric architectures in the neural net, (smoothed) sets of possible actions in domain, (smoothed) sets of possible actions out of domain) and finally to the machine actions (i.e., what it actually does in the world). We can reasonably refer to the alignment of any of these objects with any of the other objects in this long, tangled continuum of values. Two examples of outer alignment work that I have in mind here are </span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00861">Askell et al.

If nothing else, this can be viewed as an aggregation of evidence in which each agent is still left with aggregating their evidence and prior, but I don&rsquo;t like approaching such questions with a bright line between prior and posterior except in a specific prior-to-posterior Bayesian update (e.g., you believe the sky is blue but then walk outside one day and see it looks red; how should this change your belief?)</span><span>.</span></p></div></body></html>
