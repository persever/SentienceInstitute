How will we know when an AI is sentient?). Our two most notable publications this year are a report and open-access data for our 2021 </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aims-survey">Artificial Intelligence, Morality, and Sentience (AIMS) survey</a></span><span>&nbsp;and our paper in </span><span class="c2">Computers in Human Behavior</span><span>&nbsp;on &ldquo;</span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/predicting-the-moral-consideration-of-artificial-intelligences">Predicting the Moral Consideration of Artificial Intelligences</a></span><span>,</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;and we have substantial room for more funding to continue and expand this work in 2023 and beyond.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>AIMS is the first nationally representative longitudinal survey of attitudes on these topics. Even today with limited AI capabilities, we are already seeing the social relationship we have with these digital minds bearing on public discourse, funding, and other events in the trajectory of AI. The CiHB predictors paper is a deep dive into demographic and psychological predictors of AI attitudes, so we can understand why certain people view these topics in the way that they do. This follows up on our 2021 conceptual paper in </span><span class="c4 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328721000641">Futures</a></span><span>&nbsp;and literature review in </span><span class="c4 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%25252Fs11948-021-00331-8">Science and Engineering Ethics</a></span><span>. </span><span>We have also been working to build this new field through hosting a </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/podcast/">podcast</a></span><span>, an </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="http://summitonai.org">AI summit at the University of Chicago</a></span><span>, and a regular intergroup call between organizations working on this topic (e.g., Center on Long-Term Risk, Future of Humanity Institute). </span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The urgency of building this field has been underscored in two ways in 2022. First, AIs are rapidly becoming more advanced, as illustrated in the amazing performance of image generation models &mdash; OpenAI&rsquo;s DALL-E 2, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion &mdash; as well as DeepMind&rsquo;s Gato as a general-purpose transformer and high-performing language models Chinchilla and Google&rsquo;s PaLM. Second, the topic of AI sentience had one of its first spikes in the mainstream news cycle, first as OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1491554478243258368">tweeted</a></span><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;it may be that today&#39;s large neural networks are slightly conscious&rdquo; in February, and then a much larger spike as Google Engineer Blake Lemoine was fired after </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/11/google-ai-lamda-blake-lemoine/">claiming</a></span><span>&nbsp;their language model LaMDA is &ldquo;sentient.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>In 2023, we hope to continue our empirical research as well as develop these findings into a digital minds &ldquo;cause profile,&rdquo; making the case for it as a highly neglected, tractable cause area in effective altruism with an extremely large scale. The perceptions, nature, and effects of d</span><span>igital minds</span><span>&nbsp;are quickly becoming an important part of the trajectory of advanced AI systems and seem like they will continue to be so in medium- and long-term futures. This cause profile would be in part a more rigorous version of our blog post, &ldquo;</span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/the-importance-of-artificial-sentience">The Importance of Artificial Sentience</a></span><span class="c3">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>2022 has been a challenging year for effective altruism funding.

We hope to raise $90,000 this </span><span class="c9">giving</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;season for our work on digital minds, such as surveys, experimental research, the cause profile, and other field-building projects.</span><span>&nbsp;We will also continue some work on factory farming thanks to generous donors most excited about moral circle expansion in that domain, such as our </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aft-survey">Animals, Food, and Technology (AFT) survey</a></span><span>&nbsp;and an experiment on how welfare reforms like cage-free eggs affect attitudes towards animal farming in </span><span class="c4 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/animal-welfare-reforms-AFO">Anthrozo&ouml;s</a></span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>As always, we are extremely grateful to our supporters who share our vision and make this work possible.

This is the first nationally representative longitudinal survey on this topic. For example, we find that 74.91% of U.S. residents agreed that sentient AIs deserve to be treated with respect and 48.25% of people agreed that sentient AIs deserve to be included in the moral circle. Also, people who showed more moral consideration of nonhuman animals and the environment tended to show more moral consideration of sentient AIs. There is much more detail that we hope will be useful for researchers, policymakers, and others in the years to come.</span><span>&nbsp;And because this year&rsquo;s survey was the first data ever for many of these questions, we had </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/data-publication-AIMS-survey">SI researchers</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?search%3D%25222021%2520AIMS%2520survey%2522">Metaculus users</a></span><span>&nbsp;forecast the results to know how our beliefs should update.

We find, for example, that substratism, sci-fi fan identity, techno-animism, and positive emotions were the strongest predictors, suggesting that these groups of people may be the strongest supporters of AI rights, and perhaps those most vulnerable to the </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect">ELIZA effect</a></span><span class="c3">, in the years to come.</span></li><li class="c0 c11 li-bullet-0"><span>We published our first historical case study for our work on AI, &ldquo;</span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/downloads/The%2520History%2520of%2520AI%2520Rights%2520Research.pdf">The History of AI Rights Research</a></span><span>.&rdquo; This is a largely descriptive project because we did not know of any other place where the history of the field had been straightforwardly documented with this depth.

One of the panels was on AI and Nonhumans, including panelists Brian Christian and David Gunkel.</span></li><li class="c0 c11 li-bullet-0"><span>We released three new podcast episodes with philosophers </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/podcast/episode-18.html">Thomas Metzinger</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/podcast/episode-20.html">David Gunkel</a></span><span>&nbsp;and psychologist </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/podcast/episode-19.html">Kurt Gray</a></span><span>, and we have recorded episodes with one other professor researching digital minds topics</span><span>.</span></li><li class="c0 c11 li-bullet-0"><span>We reorganized parts of our website, including two new landing pages for our two longitudinal surveys, </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aims-survey">AIMS</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aft-survey">AFT</a></span><span class="c3">.</span></li><li class="c0 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">We continue to share our research via social media, emails, and meetings with people who can make use of it. In particular this year, we have been heartened by replies from academics who find our work useful in bolstering their own work on digital minds and related topics.</span></li></ul><h1 class="c8" id="h.k7wvpr4pb5hb"><span class="c1">2022 Spending</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>So far this year</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;we&rsquo;ve spent $154,362, broken down approximately as follows (85% research, 10% outreach, 5% admin). Research expenses are primarily researcher salaries; outreach this year was primarily the staff time spent on the podcast and intergroup call; and admin expenses include insurance, software, and our virtual office subscription.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 503.88px; height: 312.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/eoy2022/image1.png" style="width: 503.88px; height: 312.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>We continue to maintain a </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/transparency">Transparency</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;page with annual financial information, a running list of mistakes, and other public information.</span></p><h1 class="c8" id="h.p6z9evjq9bre"><span class="c1">Room for More Funding</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c3">We have substantial room for more funding for highly cost-effective projects. We are currently aiming to raise $90,000 this giving season (November 2022&ndash;January 2023) to continue our work on digital minds research. We also welcome donations specific to our continued work on factory farming and will do our best to ensure their counterfactual impact is only an increase in that research.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">While we know that the economic downturn and FTX&rsquo;s collapse will make fundraising difficult this year, we would be thrilled to raise more than this. For each additional $75,000 after that, we could continue hiring at least 2&ndash;3 top-tier researchers, up to a total of $300,000. Our early 2022 recruitment had 108 applicants for the generalist position (1 we hired and at least 5 more we would have been thrilled to hire) and 98 researcher applicants (2 we hired and at least 5 more we would have been thrilled to hire). If we were able to raise more, we would put forth a more ambitious plan, which we are open to, for organizational scaling in 2023 and 2024.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>If you have questions, feedback, or would like to collaborate, please email me at </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="mailto:michael@sentienceinstitute.org">michael@sentienceinstitute.org</a></span><span>.
