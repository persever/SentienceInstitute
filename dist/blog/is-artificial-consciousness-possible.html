written about whether artificial sentience or consciousness is possible.</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c5">&nbsp;In this blog post we summarize discussions of the topic from 15 books.</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;The books were chosen based on their popularity and representation of a range of perspectives on artificial consciousness. They were not randomly sampled from all of the books written on the topic. For brevity, we simply summarize the claims made by the authors, rather than critique or respond to them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">While the books contain a wide variety of terminology, we can categorize the ways they assess the possibility of artificial consciousness into three broad approaches:</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup></p><ol class="c25 lst-kix_list_2-0 start" start="1"><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The </span><span class="c3 c19 c14">computational</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;approach abstracts away from the specific implementation details of a cognitive system, such as whether it is implemented in carbon versus silicon substrate. Instead, it focuses on a higher level of analysis: the computations, algorithms, or programs that a cognitive system runs to generate its behavior. Another way of putting this is that it focuses on the software a system is running, rather than on the system&rsquo;s hardware. The computational approach is standard in the field of cognitive science (e.g., </span><span class="c2 c12"><a class="c1" href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The%2BPhilosophy%2Bof%2BCognitive%2BScience-p-9780745646572">Cain, 2015</a></span><span class="c0">) and suggests that if artificial entities implement certain computations, they will be conscious. The specific algorithms or computations that are thought to give rise to or be constitutive of consciousness differ. For example, </span><span class="c2 c12"><a class="c1" href="#h.1t3h5sf">Metzinger (2010)</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;emphasizes the importance of an internal self-model, whereas </span><span class="c2 c12"><a class="c1" href="#h.4d34og8">Dehaene (2014)</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;emphasizes the importance of a &ldquo;global workspace,&rdquo; in which information becomes available for use by multiple </span><span class="c5">subsystems</span><span class="c0">. Out of the three approaches, the computational approach typically projects the largest number of conscious artificial entities existing in the future because computational criteria are arguably easiest for an AI system to achieve. </span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The </span><span class="c3 c19 c14">physical </span><span class="c0">approach focuses on the physical details of how a cognitive system is implemented; that is, it focuses on a system&rsquo;s hardware rather than its software.</span><sup class="c19 c5 c13 c20"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;For example, </span><span class="c2 c12"><a class="c1" href="#h.44sinio">Koch (2020)</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;defends Integrated Information Theory (IIT), in which the degree of consciousness in a system depends on its degree of integrated information, that is, the degree to which the system is causally interconnected such that it is not reducible to its individual components. This integrated information needs to be present at the physical, hardware level of a system.</span><sup class="c19 c5 c20 c13"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;According to Koch, the hardware of current digital computers has very little integrated information, so they could not be conscious no matter what cognitive system they implement at the software level (e.g., a </span><span class="c2 c12"><a class="c1" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-31674-6_19">whole brain emulation</a></span><span class="c0">). However, only the physical organization matters, not the specific substrate the system is implemented in. Thus, although artificial consciousness is possible on the physical approach, it typically predicts fewer conscious artificial entities than the computational approach.</span><sup class="c19 c18 c20 c13"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup></li><li class="c4 c28 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The </span><span class="c3 c19 c14">biological</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;approach also focuses on the physical details of how a cognitive system is implemented, but it additionally emphasizes some specific aspect of biology as important for consciousness. For example, </span><span class="c2 c12"><a class="c1" href="#h.1ksv4uv">Godfrey-Smith (2020)</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;suggests that it would be very difficult to have a conscious system that isn&rsquo;t physically very similar to the brain because of some of the dynamic patterns involved in consciousness in brains. However, when pressed, even these views tend to allow for the possibility of artificial consciousness. Godfrey-Smith says that future robots with &ldquo;genuinely brain-like control systems&rdquo; could be conscious, and John Searle, perhaps the most well-known proponent of a biological approach, has </span><span class="c2 c12"><a class="c1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_naturalism">said</a></span><span class="c2 c12">,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;The fact that brain processes cause consciousness does not imply that only brains can be conscious. The brain is a biological machine, and we might build an artificial machine that was conscious; just as the heart is a machine, and we have built artificial hearts. Because we do not know exactly how the brain does it we are not yet in a position to know how to do it artificially.&rdquo; Still, the biological approach is skeptical of the possibility of artificial consciousness and the number of future conscious artificial entities is predicted to be smaller than on both the computational and physical approaches; a physical system would need to closely resemble biological brains to be conscious.</span></li></ol><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Overall, there is a broad consensus among the books that artificial consciousness is possible. According to the computational approach, which is the mainstream view in cognitive science, artificial consciousness is not only possible, but is likely to come about in the future, potentially in very large numbers. The physical and biological approaches predict that artificial consciousness will be far less widespread. Artificial sentience as an effective altruism cause area is, therefore, more likely to be promising if one favors the computational approach over the physical and biological approaches.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Which approach should we favor? Several of the books provide arguments. For example, </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="#h.3dy6vkm">Chalmers (1995)</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;uses a </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html">Silicon Chip Replacement</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;thought experiment to argue that a functionally identical silicon copy of a human brain would have the same conscious experience as a biological human brain, and from there goes on to defend a general computational account. </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="#h.2et92p0">Searle (1992)</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;uses the </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room">Chinese Room thought experiment</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;to argue that computational accounts necessarily leave out some aspects of our mental lives, such as understanding. </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="#h.3rdcrjn">Schneider (2019)</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;argues that we don&rsquo;t yet have enough information to decide between different approaches and advocates for a &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; approach. The approach that one subscribes to will depend on how convincing they find these and other arguments.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Many of the perspectives summarized in this post consider the ethical implications of creating artificial consciousness. In a popular textbook on consciousness, </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="#h.17dp8vu">Blackmore (2018)</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;argues that if we create artificial sentience, they will be capable of suffering, and we will therefore have moral responsibilities towards them. Practical suggestions from the books for how to deal with the ethical issues range from an outright ban on developing artificial consciousness until we have more information (</span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="#h.1t3h5sf">Metzinger, 2010</a></span><span class="c5">), to the view that we should deliberately try to implement consciousness in AI as a way of reducing the likelihood that future powerful AI systems will cause us harm (</span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="#h.26in1rg">Graziano, 2019</a></span><span class="c0">). Figuring out which of these and other strategies will be most beneficial is an important topic for future research.</span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.2et92p0"><span>John Searle, </span><span class="c10">The Rediscovery of the Mind</span><span class="c17 c5">, 1992</span></h1><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 33%; float: right; padding: 5px; height: auto;"><img alt="" src="images/is-artificial-consciousness-possible/image7.png" style="width: 33%; float: right; padding: 5px; height: auto; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Searle argues against the computational approach to the mind. His most well-known objection is the </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room">Chinese Room argument</a></span><span class="c0">. The argument asks us to imagine a non-Chinese speaker locked in a room with a large batch of (unbeknown to them) Chinese writing and a set of instructions written in a language they understand. The instructions tell the person how to match up and respond to inputs arriving through a slot in the door to the room, which are questions in Chinese. As the person responds with the appropriate outputs based on the instructions, and becomes increasingly good at this, it appears from the outside like they understand Chinese. However, Searle claims that the person clearly does not truly understand Chinese; from their perspective they are merely manipulating meaningless symbols based on syntactic rules. Since computer programs work in essentially the same way &mdash; operating at the level of syntax &mdash; they cannot have true understanding either. Searle concludes that the computational approach leaves out key aspects of the mind, such as understanding.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Searle has a second claim that, on standard definitions of computation, we do not discover physical systems to be carrying out computations, rather we assign this interpretation to them. That is, he argues that computation is not &ldquo;intrinsic to physics,&rdquo; rather, it is observer-relative.

He also addresses the question of whether the computed mind would be just a simulation rather than a replication of a mind with real mental states.

According to Metzinger, an AI that has the right kinds of models of external reality and its self would be conscious. Metzinger&rsquo;s approach to the question of artificial consciousness in our categorization is, therefore, computational. However, he notes that engineering such an entity is a difficult technical challenge.

For example, early systems will likely have perceptual deficits, making it difficult to perceive themselves or the world around them. In some cases, we may not be able to recognize or understand their suffering; such systems may have the capacity to suffer in ways or degrees completely unimaginable to us. Metzinger argues that because of the probability of their suffering, we should avoid trying to create artificial consciousness, and he suggests that our attention would be better directed at understanding and neutralizing our own suffering.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He also asks whether if we could, we should increase the overall amount of positive experience in the universe by colonizing it with artificial &ldquo;bliss machines.&rdquo; He argues that we should not, on the basis that there is more to an existence worth having than positive subjective experiences. He also considers whether we should have a broader pessimism about conscious experience &mdash; that the type of consciousness humans have is net negative in value, and that the evolution of consciousness has led to the expansion of suffering in the universe where before there was none. Metzinger considers that the fact that we do not have clear answers to considerations such as these gives us additional reasons to avoid trying to create artificial consciousness right now.</span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.4d34og8"><span>Stanislas Dehaene, </span><span class="c10">Consciousness and the Brain: Deciphering How the Brain Codes Our Thoughts</span><span class="c17 c5">, 2014</span></h1><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 33%; float: right; padding: 5px; height: auto;"><img alt="" src="images/is-artificial-consciousness-possible/image12.png" style="width: 33%; float: right; padding: 5px; height: auto; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Dehaene outlines the </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory#Global_neuronal_workspace">Global Neuronal Workspace</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;theory of consciousness, which states that we become conscious when information enters a &ldquo;global workspace&rdquo; in the brain where the information is made available for use by various cognitive subsystems such as perception, action, and memory.</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Dehaene sees no logical problem with the possibility of artificial consciousness, favoring a computational approach to the mind.

The transition marker they propose is &ldquo;unlimited associative learning&rdquo; (UAL). Associative learning is where a subject learns to make an association between a stimulus and another stimulus or response behavior, such as in </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="https://dictionary.apa.org/classical-conditioning">classical</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="https://dictionary.apa.org/operant-conditioning">operant</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;conditioning.

They emphasize the importance of a body for consciousness, though they note that it may be possible for such a body to be virtual, interacting in a virtual environment. They consider the requirement for a body and complex cognition to be a strong constraint on the development of conscious AI, and they expect that relatively few will be created. They do not think that mass-produced conscious AI will be a reality, and they think that conscious AI would need to go through a learning process in the way that animals do. They note that the field of developmental and evolutionary robotics take an approach that they consider more feasible.

Godfrey-Smith suggests that if the ideas in the book are right, you can&rsquo;t create a mind through modelling brains on a computer. He argues that minds are tied to particular types of physical and biological substrate. You need to do more than represent or simulate the activity in brains; the interactions between the parts actually need to be physically present. He claims that this would be more difficult with some of the higher-level dynamic patterns of the brain and suggests that it could be very difficult to have a system with anything like the brain&rsquo;s dynamic patterns that isn&rsquo;t otherwise physically very similar to the brain.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He suggests that current computers can create the illusion of agency and consciousness well, but that they are currently completely different devices to brains. His biggest disagreement is with the notion of simulated brains, such as in mind uploading &mdash; biological beings are (physically) very different to a simulation of a biological being implemented on a present-day computer. On the other end of spectrum, he considers future robots with &ldquo;genuinely brain-like control systems,&rdquo; suggesting that these could be conscious. Depending on how brain-like such control systems must be, this view could be classified as either a physical or biological approach in our categorization of approaches to artificial consciousness.</span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.44sinio"><span>Kristof Koch, </span><span class="c10">The Feeling of Life Itself: Why Consciousness Is Widespread but Can&#39;t Be Computed</span><span class="c17 c5">, 2020</span></h1><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 33%; float: right; padding: 5px; height: auto;"><img alt="" src="images/is-artificial-consciousness-possible/image5.png" style="width: 33%; float: right; padding: 5px; height: auto; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Koch defends the </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Integrated_information_theory">Integrated Information Theory</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(IIT)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of consciousness, which states that the degree of consciousness in a system depends on its degree of &ldquo;integrated information,&rdquo; which can be understood as the degree to which a system is causally interconnected such that it is not reducible to its individual components. Koch is skeptical of artificial consciousness and computationalism as an approach to studying the mind more generally, as the subtitle of the book indicates.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">He notes several differences between biological organisms and existing classical computers, such as the vastly more complex design of biological organisms, and differences on dimensions such as signal type, speed, connectivity, and robustness. He claims that today&rsquo;s most successful artificial neural networks are </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network">feedforward networks</a></span><span class="c5">, with information flowing in only one direction, but the networks in the cortex involve a great deal of feedback processing.

In addition, he notes that present day digital computers operate with very little integrated information. Even if they were used to simulate systems with a high degree of integrated information, such as a human brain, the computers themselves would have minimal integrated information and so would only be minimally conscious.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In principle, however, Koch considers artificial consciousness to be possible. It would just require computers with a very different design to today&rsquo;s computers &mdash; what he calls &ldquo;neuromorphic electronic hardware,&rdquo; where &ldquo;individual logic gates receive inputs from tens of thousands of logic gates&rdquo; and &ldquo;these massive input and output streams would overlap and feed back onto each other.&rdquo; The emphasis that Koch places on the physical organization of the system but not on any specific biological features puts his approach under the physical approach in our categorization of approaches to artificial consciousness.</span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.2jxsxqh"><span>Anil Seth, </span><span class="c10">Being You: A New Science of Consciousness</span><span class="c17 c5">, 2021</span></h1><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 33%; float: right; padding: 5px; height: auto;"><img alt="" src="images/is-artificial-consciousness-possible/image9.png" style="width: 33%; float: right; padding: 5px; height: auto; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Seth details a theory of consciousness grounded in the biological drive of embodied, living beings towards staying alive. Seth considers that artificial consciousness depends on two assumptions: (1) </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="https://iep.utm.edu/functism/">functionalism</a></span><span class="c0">, the view that mental states are defined by the role they play in a cognitive system, which he holds a stance of &ldquo;suspicious agnosticism&rdquo; towards, and (2) that the kind of computation that gives rise to artificial intelligence is the same as that which would give rise to consciousness. He thinks issues associated with these views are glossed over, and artificial consciousness is unlikely to be &ldquo;around the corner.&rdquo; He describes a silicon-based machine that is functionally equivalent to a human. In the theory developed in the book he says he is uncertain about whether the silicon-based machine would be conscious, but he doubts that it would be. He notes, however, that he is relying somewhat on his intuition that consciousness depends on some aspect of biology rather than on computation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">While Seth&rsquo;s approach seems closest to a purely biological approach of all the books considered, he still does not completely rule out artificial consciousness and considers the question to be an important one to be concerned about. He makes a distinction between how we ought to treat entities that appear conscious but are not and what we should do if true artificial sentience is created. With the former, there may be unintended consequences such as granting them moral consideration at the expense of conscious entities, such as nonhuman animals. With the latter, he thinks that we would be obligated to minimize their suffering. He also notes that there is a problem that we might not understand what AI conscious states are like. For example, they may experience entirely new forms of suffering for which we have no conception, or some may have no conception or distinction between positive and negative experiential states. He considers whether biotechnology rather than AI is what will bring us closest to artificial consciousness, asking whether &ldquo;</span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_organoid">cerebral organoids</a></span><span class="c0">&rdquo; &mdash; brain like structures made of real neurons used as models to study brains &mdash; could have some basic level of consciousness.

A key issue relating to these ideas is whether entirely simulated entities living in virtual words will be conscious. Chalmers discusses the ethical implications of this question: if such entities are conscious, then shutting down a virtual world containing many simulated brains would be an atrocity; on the other hand, if the simulated brains are not conscious, it would seem to be no worse than turning off an ordinary computer game. To understand whether simulated entities would be conscious, Chalmers asks us to first consider the case of a perfect simulation of a human brain running on a digital computer. He then uses the Fading Qualia argument,</span><sup class="c13"><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;adapted to the case of simulations, to argue that a gradually uploaded simulation of a human brain would be conscious. As with his original Fading Qualia argument, Chalmers argues that since the gradually uploaded simulation of a human brain would be conscious, we can know there is no in-principle reason that simulated entities can&rsquo;t be conscious, and that this &ldquo;opens the floodgates&rdquo; to many different possible types of conscious simulated entities. These claims fall under the computational approach.</span></p><p class="c4 c27"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr class="c24"><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt1">[1]</a><span class="c7 c18">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c5">While we are mainly concerned about artificial sentience, many books consider the question of artificial consciousness. These terms are used in different ways, but we prefer to use &ldquo;sentience&rdquo; to refer to the capacity for positive and/or negative experiences and &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; as a broader term for this and other experiences (e.g., visual experience).

These categories are also not made precise in most works. Another way to think of them is as two spectrums, one from an emphasis on low-level criteria to high-level criteria, and one from an emphasis on the contingencies of biology (particularly low-level biology) to an emphasis on a priori reasoning about consciousness.

If the entity at the end has no conscious experience, there are two possibilities: 1) either their experience gradually fades away as the parts are replaced, or 2) it suddenly disappears.

This would suggest that at some stage, the flip could be switched back and forth, and the person&rsquo;s conscious experience would &ldquo;dance&rdquo; back and forth, but they would not notice any change, even if they were paying full attention.
