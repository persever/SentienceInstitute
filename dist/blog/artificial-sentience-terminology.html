When we survey the public, we use the terms &ldquo;artificial beings&rdquo; and &ldquo;robots/AIs&rdquo; to refer to &ldquo;intelligent entities built by humans, such as robots, virtual copies of human brains, or computer programs that solve problems, with or without a physical body, that may exist now or in the future.&rdquo; We have also used the terms &ldquo;artificial intelligences&rdquo; and &ldquo;artificial entities.&rdquo; These five terms are just a few of the many used in the design, development, and scholarship of AI.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c17 c12"><span>When a term t</span><span>hat expresses a concept is ambiguous, </span><span>it becomes difficult to disentangle the theoretical connotation intended by the researchers and the meaning of participants&rsquo; responses in empirical studies. This reduces the impact of empirical research, especially for concepts that are tied to ordinary language like &ldquo;artificial.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Researchers may assume that everyone shares their same definitions when in fact they are fuzzy concepts, &ldquo;[that] possess two or more alternative meanings and thus cannot be reliably identified or applied by different readers or scholars&rdquo; (</span><span class="c11"><a class="c3" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0034340032000108796">Markusen, 2003</a></span><span class="c0">, p. 702). Markusen argues that this can decrease scholars&rsquo; belief in the need for empirical tests, can lead to the devaluation of empirical evidence, and can reduce the credibility of research.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c17 c12"><span>Conceptual ambiguity can lead to </span><span class="c11"><a class="c3" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2016.1082418">concept creep</a></span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;when a concept becomes so broad and deep that non-examples are difficult to find. </span><span>The methodological and real-world implications of conceptual ambiguity range from reduced trustworthiness of the research to the detachment of scholarship from policy-making and advocacy. For instance, a policy-maker is more likely to avoid &ldquo;fuzzy concepts&rdquo; when implementing policies because there are no clear definitions that can be used to structure their policy. That is, &ldquo;fuzzy concepts&rdquo; provide fuzzy guidance on how a policy will affect systemic power distributions, legal structures, and the actions of different people (e.g., advocates, politicians, lay people).</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c17 c12"><span>In the following sections, we attempt to include as many of the terms as we could find relevant to the interdisciplinary study of artificial entities&rsquo; moral, social, and mental capacities.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c17 c12"><span class="c19 c7">Note. We loosely group terms into four categories although several terms could belong to other categories. </span></p><h1 class="c12 c22" id="h.pyjtf8okj61i"><span class="c5">Terminology and conceptual definitions</span></h1><p class="c17 c12"><span class="c0">The first set of terms elicits a mental image of an entity&rsquo;s role in the world. These terms are most frequently used as nouns that can be modified with information about their material or psychological features, although some, like &ldquo;super&rdquo; and &ldquo;transformative,&rdquo; typically serve as adjectives. &ldquo;Machine&rdquo; is used as a noun with feature modifiers (e.g., &ldquo;digital machine,&rdquo; &ldquo;autonomous machine&rdquo;). However, it is also sometimes used as a feature-like modifier of other features (e.g., &ldquo;machine intelligence&rdquo;). Below are terms defining an entity&rsquo;s role. </span></p><h4 class="c12 c26" id="h.ikewjbl87wn2"><span class="c7">Table 1:</span><span class="c24">&nbsp;Terminology defining an entity&rsquo;s role</span></h4><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR18_wPdaUaf14TMq_J2avf7quI1nK_RrDftpaBSa04ResU2EPf5Bx6pCgw_ZWYPkAOz30kl0OU0k4o/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;range=a1:e15&amp;single=true&amp;widget=false&amp;headers=false&amp;chrome=false" width="100%" height="800"></iframe><p class="c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c17 c12"><span class="c0">The second set of terms evokes a mental image of an artificial entity&rsquo;s material structure. These terms focus either on what the entity is made from or how they exist. They often modify terms defining an entity&rsquo;s role (e.g., &ldquo;artificial agent&rdquo;). Below are terms defining material features.</span></p><h4 class="c26 c12" id="h.icdiftajrsiq"><span class="c7">Table 2:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c24">&nbsp;Terminology defining material features</span></h4><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR18_wPdaUaf14TMq_J2avf7quI1nK_RrDftpaBSa04ResU2EPf5Bx6pCgw_ZWYPkAOz30kl0OU0k4o/pubhtml?gid=374511274&amp;range=a1:e9&amp;single=true&amp;widget=false&amp;headers=false&amp;chrome=false" width="100%" height="800"></iframe><p class="c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c17 c12"><span class="c0">A third set of terms defines the psychological features of an entity. These terms operationalize abstract and indirectly observable mental phenomena (e.g., intelligence, friendliness). Psychological features are inferred from observing complex criteria agreed upon by experts. For example, we cannot observe &ldquo;autonomy&rdquo; directly. We infer &ldquo;autonomy&rdquo; from introspection (i.e., self-reports) and behavior. These terms differ from material features because material features can be directly observed. Below are terms defining psychological features.</span></p><h4 class="c26 c12" id="h.cmci3dfe2ck0"><span class="c7">Table 3:</span><span class="c24">&nbsp;Terminology defining psychological features</span></h4><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR18_wPdaUaf14TMq_J2avf7quI1nK_RrDftpaBSa04ResU2EPf5Bx6pCgw_ZWYPkAOz30kl0OU0k4o/pubhtml?gid=1073971666&amp;range=a1:e12&amp;single=true&amp;widget=false&amp;headers=false&amp;chrome=false" width="100%" height="800"></iframe><p class="c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c17 c12"><span>Combinations of feature and role terms have been used within and across many fields of study</span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;to describe artificial entities. For instance, &ldquo;</span><span class="c11"><a class="c3" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-020-09556-w">friendly AI</a></span><span>&rdquo; has been used to describe AIs who mimic human friendliness and are benign to humans. &ldquo;</span><span class="c11"><a class="c3" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0637-6.">Moral machine</a></span><span class="c0">&rdquo; has been used to describe machines that make ethical decisions or need to solve moral dilemmas, like self-driving cars. Some of these combinations are more widely used and well-known. Other combinations have stronger implications for taking moral action and receiving moral consideration. Many combinations are used only in specific contexts, based on convenience, or merely as placeholders. Below we outline some combinations that we think are consequential and related to the moral consideration of artificial entities.</span></p><h4 class="c26 c12" id="h.kxo3d2vpqh52"><span class="c7">Table 4:</span><span class="c24">&nbsp;Consequential combinations of features and role</span></h4><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR18_wPdaUaf14TMq_J2avf7quI1nK_RrDftpaBSa04ResU2EPf5Bx6pCgw_ZWYPkAOz30kl0OU0k4o/pubhtml?gid=1950794443&amp;range=a1:e12&amp;single=true&amp;widget=false&amp;headers=false&amp;chrome=false" width="100%" height="800"></iframe><h1 class="c9" id="h.q0xhbhrjbcrr"><span class="c5">What term should we use?</span></h1><p class="c4"><span>Is the same terminology useful for the general public, engineers, scientists, ethicists, lawyers, and policy-makers? There&rsquo;s </span><span class="c11"><a class="c3" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3434074.3446911">some suggestion</a></span><span>&nbsp;that the general public and experts differ in their understanding of artificial entities and support for their rights. Would a common, consensual terminology enable more effective interdisciplinary research, policy-making, and advocacy? If having an </span><span class="c11"><a class="c3" href="https://intelligence.org/2013/06/19/what-is-intelligence-2/">imprecise definition</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is preferred, how can differences in terminology be reconciled to maximize the clarity and utility of the terms?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Whether or not terms generalize across contexts might matter. Should we use terminology that can be applied to humans, nonhuman animals, algorithms, and machines? Is it necessary to specify an entity&rsquo;s role? Several of the consequential combinations do not (e.g., &ldquo;artificial general intelligence,&rdquo; &ldquo;artificial sentience&rdquo;). Does the psychological feature need to be narrow or broad? &ldquo;Consciousness&rdquo; is broad, but it is also &ldquo;fuzzy&rdquo; because of the many conceptualizations in current usage. On the other hand, a narrow term like &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; only applies to one aspect of an entity&rsquo;s behavior and may not retain meaning over time and across context.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Below we explain our preference for &ldquo;artificial sentience,&rdquo; consider some possible reasons not to use &ldquo;artificial sentience,&rdquo; and consider using multiple terms.</span></p><h2 class="c21" id="h.wd70rlsamahb"><span>Reasons for &ldquo;artificial sentience</span><span class="c15">&rdquo;</span></h2><p class="c4"><span>We favor the term &ldquo;artificial sentience&rdquo; for the following </span><span class="c23">linguistic </span><span class="c0">reasons:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_os1ya0pym7px-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Artificial sentience&rdquo; sits in a &ldquo;Goldilocks Zone&rdquo; of broad and narrow terminology. &ldquo;Artificial&rdquo; is inclusive of many entities and distinguishes entities composed at least partly of non-biological substrates from completely biological entities. &ldquo;Artificial&rdquo; is commonly used and understood in relevant contexts. &ldquo;Sentience&rdquo; is an aspect of &ldquo;mind&rdquo; that can be differentiated from broad and narrow psychological features such as &ldquo;mind&rdquo; and &ldquo;intelligence,&rdquo; respectively.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span>&ldquo;Artificial sentience,&rdquo; as a newer term, does not have divergent meanings across time and field of study like the dual meanings that exist for some terms (e.g., &ldquo;digital mind&rdquo;). </span><span class="c11"><a class="c3" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/digital-mind">Scholars</a></span><span>&nbsp;concerned with the</span><span class="c11"><a class="c3" href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780192894076.001.0001/oso-9780192894076-chapter-18">&nbsp;effects of AIs on human society</a></span><span>&nbsp;have used &ldquo;digital mind&rdquo; to refer to </span><span class="c11"><a class="c3" href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S1793843012400161">psychological minds that exist purely on a computer</a></span><span>&nbsp;or in a digital space.
