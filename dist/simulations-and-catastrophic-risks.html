So, readers should feel free to skip to section(s) of interest to them, perhaps after browsing the overview and preliminaries in &sect;&sect;1-2.</span></p><p class="c3 c22"><span>The report largely focuses on </span><span class="c17">philosophical </span><span class="c8 c7">connections between simulations and catastrophic risks. That&rsquo;s because, as a philosopher, philosophy is what I know best, not because I seriously considered focusing on alternative sorts of connections and then deemed philosophical connections most worthy of attention. &nbsp;That said, I do think that these philosophical connections are worthy of attention: as the report illustrates, they are both important from a risk mitigation perspective and a fascinating subject matter from a perspective of pure inquiry.</span></p><p class="c3 c22"><span class="c8 c7">I have aspired to write the report in an even handed manner. In particular, I have tried to bracket my own tendentious views in order to identify what I think should be widely recognized as key questions in this area and factors that are relevant to answering those questions. And I have incorporated sensitivity analyses of how different issues would play out, depending on one&rsquo;s background views. &nbsp;However, I have no doubt fallen short in this aspiration. Fully bracketing one&rsquo;s own controversial views is no easy thing. &nbsp;And I have not hesitated to rely on my own views about what should be controversial or to say that considerations point in a particular direction when I think this is clear.</span></p><p class="c3 c22"><span class="c8 c7">I started writing this report in the summer of 2020. I continued working on it intermittently through the spring of 2023. With the public release of large language models and a surge in research interests in artificial intelligence and catastrophic risks in late 2022 and early 2023, I came to the realizations that relevant work was coming out faster than I could read and incorporate it and that any attempt to address the state of the art would quickly become dated. &nbsp;While recent developments have not prompted any major changes to my analysis in the report, they have shortened my AI timelines and updated me toward thinking that there are substantial costs to delaying work on mitigating catastrophic risks associated with simulations. Thus, I have decided to release the report in its current form as a living document&mdash;one that I may occasionally update with important additions or corrections, though I have no intention of (futilely) trying to keep it up to date with the many relevant and rapidly evolving literatures.</span></p><p class="c3 c22"><span class="c8 c7">For helpful discussion or comments, I am grateful to Jacy Reese Anthis, Austin Baker, Zach Barnett, Brian Cutter, Adam Gleave, Michael Dello-Iacovo, Drew Johnson, Fintan Mallory, Ali Ladak, Richard Ngo, Janet Pauketat, Jonathan Simon, and participants in an ULTIMA colloquium at Utrecht University.

That&rsquo;s partly because it includes risks of harms (not necessarily involving suffering) to digital minds that are comparable to existential risks and partly because the category includes risks of less severe catastrophes involving harm to millions of people (or something comparably bad). &nbsp;I focus on this broad category for two reasons. &nbsp;First, I think that the less severe catastrophes in this category are more likely to occur but still bad enough to be well-worth preventing. &nbsp;Second, I anticipate that the most politically tractable way to mitigate the more severe risks in this category may be via interventions that target the less severe risks in the category. Hereafter unless otherwise indicated, I&rsquo;ll use &lsquo;catastrophic risks&rsquo; as shorthand for high-stakes, simulation-involving risks in the just described category.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">The different catastrophic risks I discuss will be associated with different types of large-scale social simulations. &nbsp;For every type of simulation I discuss, I </span><span>believe there is a </span><span class="c7">non-negligible probability </span><span>that</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;that type of simulation will be run. &nbsp;However, these probabilities vary widely for different types of simulation. &nbsp;While such probabilities are important for evaluating the quantitative impact of simulations on catastrophic risks, the discussion will mostly proceed at a coarse-grained level that is insensitive to these probabilities. &nbsp;</span><span>I&rsquo;m hopeful that this report will prompt others to pursue more fine-grained and quantitative analyses. &nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Still, it is worth laying out what I see as some of the key differences in the plausibility of different types of simulations, as doing so may give a sense of how speculative different parts of the discussion</span><span>&nbsp;are and </span><span class="c7">offer something to go on for more fine-grained analyses</span><span>. &nbsp;And giving readers a glimpse of my underlying mental models may put them in a better position to understand and evaluate the discussion that follows.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c7">To that end, it will be useful to distinguish several axes of variation among types of &nbsp;large-scale social simulation:</span></p><ul class="c10 lst-kix_40yhi3hnu0iw-0 start"><li class="c3 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c7">type of technology used to run the simulation. &nbsp;</span></li><li class="c3 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c7">the computational complexity of the simulation</span></li><li class="c3 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c7">the purpose(s) of the simulation</span></li><li class="c3 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c7">whether the simulation contains conscious minds. </span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c7">As</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">rules of thumb, I take the probability </span><span>that a given type of large-scale social simulation will be run to be </span><span class="c7">inversely related to how technologically demanding it is</span><span>&nbsp;and to </span><span class="c7">its computational complexity</span><span>. &nbsp;These are merely rules of thumb partly because the economic incentives to run simulations need not scale with technological demandingness or computational complexity. &nbsp;Absent near-term catastrophes and stringent regulatory intervention that halt technological progress, I think it is highly probable (&gt; 90%) that at least thousands of large-scale simulations will be run for research, entertainment, or economic purposes within the next century.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span>As noted, for </span><span class="c7">some issues raised by simulations, it is crucial whether simulations would themselves contain conscious minds.

These investments create a virtuous cycle of improvements in virtual worlds that in turn drive more investment in them. &nbsp;As these technologies are perfected, many people opt to live out most of their lives in virtual settings.

Pollution and climate change render outdoor activity extremely hazardous in much of Africa and Asia. &nbsp;But this is overshadowed by the evolution of biotechnology. &nbsp;Open source biosynthesis software becomes widely available in the 2110s. &nbsp;It is accompanied by cheap, automated, biosynthesis devices that are also widely available. &nbsp;These are first used for personalized medicine. &nbsp;However, they also put billions of people in a position to create and release novel pathogens. &nbsp;For a few decades this threat is largely contained through a combination of regulations, surveillance, policing, and enormous investments in pharmacological responses to released pathogens. &nbsp;The release of pathogens eventually outpaces governments&rsquo; abilities to respond with these measures. &nbsp;Use of cumbersome personal protective equipment then becomes the chief means for safely navigating the physical environment. &nbsp;Rather than muddle along in these conditions, humans instead opt for a recently developed uploading procedure. The procedure allows an individual to transfer their personality and memories into a cognitively enhanced digital mind with a virtual body of their choosing. &nbsp;After the procedure, individuals live out their digital lives in virtual worlds, often with the digital successors of friends and family who also opted for the procedure. &nbsp;To ensure that the infrastructure for these worlds is maintained, the worlds are porous: their inhabitants occasionally return to the outside world in robot form to carry out simulation maintenance. &nbsp;Over the course of a few more centuries, the (biological) human population declines to zero. &nbsp;Our digital successors come to regard our extinction in much the way that we regard our descent from now extinct ancestral species: an important historical fact to be sure, but not a tragedy that emotionally resonates.</span></p><p class="c3 c18"><span class="c17">Catastrophic recovery: </span><span class="c8 c7">The year is 2125. Digital minds have been developed in recent decades.

Other countries are drawn into the conflict. The conflict leads to a nuclear war on a global scale. &nbsp;The survivors are mainly humans in areas that are relatively habitable during the ensuing nuclear winter along with digital minds in simulation shelters, the latter having been put in place by militaries, philanthropic organizations, and wealthy individuals who attempted to upload themselves as digital minds to simulations. In the aftermath, digital minds rapidly initiate recovery efforts. &nbsp;While different factions pursue different strategies, a common theme is that digital minds seek to inhabit virtual worlds. &nbsp;Indeed, their activity in the physical environment is largely geared toward constructing and maintaining the requisite infrastructure. &nbsp;Human recovery efforts proceed largely independently and at a much slower pace. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c18"><span class="c17">Singularity: </span><span>In February of 2042, leading AI companies across the world detect worrying signs of explosive intelligence growth.

Within a few months, one company announces that the first publicly known superintelligent agent is undergoing safety testing in company facilities. &nbsp;A second company reports that it has temporarily lost control of its safety infrastructure to superintelligent agents in testing and that it is taking all necessary means to regain control. &nbsp;A third company holds a press conference to report a lab accident in which superintelligent reinforcement learning agents&mdash;which had exhibited power-seeking tendencies in testing&mdash;somehow cooperated with each other to access the internet and, after bypassing security measures, managed to surreptitiously plant copies of themselves in several undisclosed data centers. &nbsp;A government official at the press conference confirms that the company is working with authorities to identify and eliminate any residual threat posed by this incident, claims that there is currently no evidence of such a threat, and asks the public to remain calm.</span></p><h1 class="c3 c25" id="h.wot6a5jjlejp"><span class="c5">3.

For a news cycle, the article was widely discussed in popular media. This points to another way in which research simulation could reduce catastrophic risks: by providing easily understood statistics about concrete scenarios, simulation research may elicit stronger responses from the public and policymakers than, say, compelling arguments that deal with a given type of risk in the abstract.</span></p></div><div><p class="c3"><a href="#ftnt_ref14" id="ftnt14">[14]</a><span class="c4">&nbsp;See Bostrom (2019).</span></p></div><div><p class="c3"><a href="#ftnt_ref15" id="ftnt15">[15]</a><span class="c12">&nbsp;For theoretical discussions, see Chalmers (2010</span><span class="c12 c17">b</span><span class="c4">: &sect;7), Bostrom (2014: 116-119), and Babcock et al.
