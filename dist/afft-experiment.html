<meta name="citation_abstract" content="There is limited research on the effects of animal-free food technologies (AFFT), such as cultured meat and new plant-based foods that accurately mimic animal products, on attitudes toward animal farming. This study found that providing participants with information about AFFT significantly lowered animal farming opposition (AFO) relative to participants who were provided with information about low-technology plant-based foods or about an unrelated topic. The results suggest that including information about AFFT in advocacy materials can be detrimental to attitudinal change. Information about low-technology plant-based foods had no significant effects on AFO relative to information about an unrelated topic, so does not seem to have this downside.">

How does discussion of AFFT affect attitudes towards animal farming and AFFT? This question has important implications for the foundational question of whether effectiveness-focused advocates should prioritize working on </span><span>social change, such as through activism, or on developing better AFFT.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;For example, if awareness of AFFT reduces support for policies that restrict animal farming (e.g. a ban on slaughterhouses), perhaps because consumers think the ethical and environmental problems of animal farming will be solved anyway by AFFT, then this is a negative impact of activism that emphasizes AFFT.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>The full list of hypotheses for this study and our estimates of the likelihood of particular outcomes are </span><span>available </span><span class="c2"><a class="c17" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17s6ZOAVif95KM594tEJWIfB271uguGave0oVcDfwZxw/edit?usp%3Dsharing">here</a></span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;The second tab provides summaries of our views on the foundational questions that we hoped that this study would provide evidence on, before, and after the data was collected.</span></p><h2 class="c23" id="h.axkrv9jdzv4s"><span>The effects of AFFT on Animal Farming Opposition</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The main aim of this study was to assess whether and to what extent Animal Farming Opposition (AFO) is affected by the provision of information about AFFT.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>In this study, AFO was measured through five questions from Sentience Institute&rsquo;s 2017 and 2019 US surveys, selected based on exploratory factor analysis.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;These questions ask about people&rsquo;s willingness to support bans on animal farming, factory farming, or slaughterhouses, their willingness to join a demonstration against factory farming, and their discomfort with the way animals are used in the food industry.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>There are several plausible </span><span>psychological </span><span>mechanisms through which AFFT might influence AFO:</span></p><ul class="c44 lst-kix_naok24j8kkou-0 start"><li class="c4 c14"><span>It migh</span><span>t increase the cognitive dissonance experienced by omnivores by emphasizing that conventional animal products are made using animals and that alternatives to these products exist.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;</span><span>To reduce this dissonance, omnivores may change the underlying beliefs that are dissonant with the emphasized information, such as by reducing their care for animals.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Alternatively</span><span>, if emphasizing the availability of AFFT leads omnivores to expect that they will eat fewer animal products in the future,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;this might reduce the need for omnivores to engage in these dissonance-reducing strategies. In other words, omnivores might expect to gain the freedom to care about animals, so they might move towards the level of care that they would have in a world where they did not eat animals.</span></li><li class="c4 c14"><span>It might challenge the justifications for animal product consumption. In one survey, the &ldquo;4 N&rsquo;s&rdquo; of meat consumption (&ldquo;the belief that eating meat is natural, normal, necessary, and nice&rdquo;) accounted for 83&ndash;91% of the top three justifications given by each consumer for why they believe it is acceptable to eat meat.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Awareness of AFFT could reduce confidence in the beliefs that eating animal products is necessary (if AFFT is seen as a viable alternative), nicer than the alternatives (if AFFT are also seen to be similarly enjoyable to consume), or normal</span><span>&nbsp;(if consumption of AFFT is perceived to be widespread)</span><span>. There is evidence that increased familiarity with AFFTs and perceptions that cultured meat is more widely consumed are associated with stronger intentions to consume them.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Awareness could, however, strengthen the naturalness rationale by suggesting that animal-free alternatives are unnatural.</span></li><li class="c4 c14"><span>It might decrease the extent to which people associate animals with food by disentangling animals with meat, dairy, or egg products.</span><span>&nbsp;Previous studies have demonstrated that people ascribe lower mental capacities to animals that they consider appropriate for human consumption.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Alternatively, it could increase the association of animals with food by emphasizing that many food products currently contain animals.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup></li><li class="c4 c14"><span>It might increase people&rsquo;s optimism that animal farming will end</span><span>. This could make people less likely to dismiss actions to help animals as only a &ldquo;drop in the bucket,&rdquo; making a small contribution to addressing a vast and unsolvable problem. Previous studies have found evidence of a </span><span class="c8">collapse of compassion</span><span>&nbsp;as awareness of the number of victims increases,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and of </span><span class="c8">proportion dominance</span><span>, the phenomenon whereby addressing a large proportion of a problem is preferred to making a larger absolute contribution when the proportion of the problem that would be addressed in the latter case is lower.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Alternatively, it could encourage perceptions of the end of animal farming as inevitable, and make people more likely to dismiss actions to help animals as unnecessary.</span></li><li class="c4 c14"><span>It might be viewed as an alternative to animal farming, and thus if participants see it as a good alternative, it makes animal farming seem relatively less appealing and AFO could increase. If participants see AFFT as a bad alternative, it makes animal farming seem relatively more appealing and AFO could decrease. Macdonald and Vivalt (2017) found evidence that changes in beliefs could be contingent upon perceptions of the quality of AFFT, which fits with this mechanism.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup></li></ul><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Increased awareness of AFFT could therefore encourage positive or negative changes in AFO.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup></p><h2 class="c23" id="h.mdyzvjv4nr0v"><span>Comparison to plausible counterfactuals</span></h2><p class="c4"><span>AFFT proponents can incorporate information about AFFT into online ads, op-eds, and documentaries, or choose to omit such information and focus on other messaging tactics. Previous research has found evidence that, compared to a no-information control, providing information about conventional animal farming</span><span>&nbsp;affects </span><span>attitudes and behaviors towards animals,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;but Macdonald and Vivalt (2017) found slightly negative effects of including information about AFFT within messaging about the harms of conventional animal farming.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;</span><span>This</span><span>&nbsp;suggests that animal advocates should prioritize messaging tactics that do not focus on AFFT, though Macdonald and Vivalt leave some room for optimism that some messaging around AFFT may still be effective.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The present study provides more evidence on this topic using different messaging conditions and outcome measures. </span><span>Two intervention </span><span>groups received information about the development of AFFT products and one of the control groups received information about the development of a low-tech plant-based food product.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Comparison between these groups reflects the differing effects of some of the messaging strategies available to farmed animal advocates and other AFFT proponents, such as emphasizing &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; or &ldquo;low-tech&rdquo; animal-free foods.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Food companies and researchers that produce, support, or sell AFFT can actively seek media attention through press releases or choose to share progress towards their goals only with investors and donors.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;News items about AFFT will not always compete for space on news sites, televisions, and social media feeds with other content about the harms of animal agriculture; instead, they may compete with mostly unrelated topics.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;To the authors&rsquo; knowledge, no experiment has evaluated the effects of news articles about AFFT compared to unrelated news content.

In doing so, red meat such as ground beef is produced in the laboratory. This production method is more environment-friendly and &nbsp;associated with less animal suffering compared with traditional meat production. Consumption of in vitro ground beef is comparable with consumption of ground beef from traditional meat production, also with regard to taste.&rdquo; The other group was provided with comparable information about organic meat. They found that, &ldquo;[t]he participants assigned to the in vitro meat condition perceived traditional meat as significantly more natural (M = 73.03, SD = 18.85) compared with the participants in the organic meat group (M = 53.96, SD = 22.14), t(202) = 6.63, p &lt; 0.001. Furthermore, the experimental manipulation affected the participants&rsquo; willingness to eat traditional meat. The participants assigned to the in vitro meat condition indicated that they were more likely to consume traditional meat (M = 77.13, SD = 25.16) compared with the participants in the organic meat group (M = 58.15, SD = 32.69), t(202) = 4.65, p &lt; 0.001.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">However, the description of the production methods of cultured meat seems less favorable than the descriptions that the proponents of AFFT, or indeed journalists and news outlets, seem likely to use. Indeed, a subsequent experiment, described in the same paper, suggests that nontechnical descriptions of cultured meat evoke less disgust and perceived unnaturalness than technical descriptions do, though the experiment does not analyze whether nontechnical descriptions encourage positive evaluations of conventional meat in a manner comparable to the first experiment. Additionally, these experiments measured attitudes towards cultured meat and conventional meat rather than attitudes towards animal farming more generally.</span></p></div><div><p class="c5"><a href="#ftnt_ref20" id="ftnt20">[20]</a><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;See footnote 15.</span></p></div><div><p class="c5"><a href="#ftnt_ref21" id="ftnt21">[21]</a><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;Such decisions may not always be as readily available to academic researchers working on AFFT, though academics have proactively sought media attention in the past, as with Mark Post&rsquo;s public unveiling of &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s first cultured beef burger&rdquo; at &ldquo;an event attended by 200 journalists and academics&rdquo; where &ldquo;the cultured beef burger was cooked and tasted live&rdquo; (&ldquo;Launch of the world&rsquo;s first cultured meat hamburger (August 5, 2013),&rdquo; Mosa Meat (Jan 13, 2018), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slslQLZL2EI).</span></p></div><div><p class="c5"><a href="#ftnt_ref22" id="ftnt22">[22]</a><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;Information on AFFT could plausibly displace news or marketing content on technology and food topics.
