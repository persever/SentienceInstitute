<meta name="citation_abstract" content="We surveyed 1,094 US adults, census-balanced to be representative of age, sex, region, ethnicity, and income, on their attitudes towards animal farming and animal-free food. Among other insights, we found that 49% of US adults support a ban on factory farming, 47% support a ban on slaughterhouses, and 33% support a ban on animal farming, suggesting that animal-free food advocates might be more successful with a stronger focus on institutions than individuals, and with stronger institutional proposals than they currently campaign for." />

If, for example, the public is much more opposed to factory farming and animal farming than we expect, that might suggest we should use stronger messages in our advocacy, e.g. &ldquo;end animal farming&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;end battery cages.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c0 c1 c26"><span class="c2">Conduct exploratory analysis on the associations between responses and demographics. While we don&rsquo;t expect this information to make a big difference to advocacy decisions, it could suggest interesting follow-up research questions, for example, how gender, race/ethnicity, and region relate to opposition to animal farming.</span></li></ol><p class="c0 c1 c15"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span>Regarding 2, if you would like to note your predictions before seeing the results of the survey, please see </span><span class="c23"><a class="c9" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zM6sgbcyppgB7yVjw4zHLosM6LGCdS3XzX1vOuw3iYo/edit">this spreadsheet</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;for the question text. The complete survey code can be found in the Appendix.</span></p><h1 class="c12 c1" id="h.g3ypyumw3g3b"><span class="c19">Main Results</span></h1><ul class="c38 lst-kix_6tl3vxmq98bh-0 start"><li class="c0 c1 c26"><span class="c2">54% of US adults say they are &ldquo;currently trying to consume fewer animal-based foods (meat, dairy, and/or eggs) and more plant-based foods (fruits, grains, beans, and/or vegetables).&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c0 c1 c26"><span class="c2">97% of US adults agree &ldquo;Whether to eat animals or be vegetarian is a personal choice, and nobody has the right to tell me which one they think I should do.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c0 c1 c26"><span class="c2">49% of US adults support a ban on factory farming, 47% support a ban on slaughterhouses, and 33% support a ban on animal farming. The support for the latter two exceeded even researcher expectations. This suggests that animal-free food advocates might be able to succeed with stronger proposals than they currently use, though readers should take into consideration social desirability bias in this type of survey.</span></li><li class="c0 c1 c26"><span>58% of US adults think &ldquo;most farmed animals are treated well,&rdquo; despite those same estimates and over a decade of undercover investigations in the US and USDA data suggesting over 99% of farmed animals live on factory farms.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;This suggests either we have insufficient awareness of factory farming, or people have refused to accept the evidence, perhaps due to the emphasis on individual diet change and subsequent cognitive dissonance with their own eating habits.</span></li><li class="c0 c1 c26"><span>75% of US adults say they usually buy animal products &ldquo;from animals that are treated humanely,&rdquo; despite estimates suggesting fewer than 1% of US farmed animals live on non-factory farms.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;This suggests a </span><span class="c16">psychological refuge</span><span>&nbsp;effect where people justify their animal product consumption by incorrectly assuming they are eating ethically-produced food.</span></li></ul><h1 class="c12 c1" id="h.6xraprazvgka"><span class="c19">Methodological notes</span></h1><p class="c0 c1"><span>We chose Ipsos as a sample provider based on brief discussions with several nationally representative survey providers about their methodologies and costs. We found Ipsos to be very helpful and professional, especially in their patience and flexibility with our </span><span>many</span><span>&nbsp;questions and unusual need for rigor. They were also affordable compared to their competitors. We highly recommend </span><span class="c23"><a class="c9" href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/field-delivery">Ipsos</a></span><span>&nbsp;to any researchers wanting to conduct a similar survey, though researchers should account for the difficulty in getting a survey sample </span><span>that is census-balanced with education level</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c0 c1 c15"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span>We chose not to randomize the order of questions in the survey because the survey questions were already complex and unusual enough that we wanted to maximize understandability. This could make questions that came later in the survey less comparable with those that came earlier due to priming, anchoring, or social desirability effects. Similarly, we chose not to reverse many questions (e.g. &ldquo;I do not support a ban on factory farming&rdquo;) in order to minimize confusion</span><span>, but we were conflicted about both of these and might have made the wrong decisions</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c0 c1 c15"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span>The introduction to the survey was as follows: &ldquo;Thank you for participating in this survey. Your honest responses will help researchers better understand public perception of the current food system. Please note that you cannot go back in this survey, so please take your time before clicking on an answer.&rdquo; We avoided identifying Sentience Institute as the survey</span><span>o</span><span>r, or saying anything about advocacy, to minimize any expectations that we wanted them to show more opposition to animal farming in their responses. That being said, this expectation should still be considered when interpreting responses. For more information on social desirability bias in the animal advocacy context, see Animal Charity Evaluators&rsquo; </span><span class="c23"><a class="c9" href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/for-charities/develop-a-survey/what-to-consider/#sourcesoferror">write-up</a></span><span>&nbsp;on the </span><span>subject</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c0 c1 c15"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span>We </span><span class="c23"><a class="c9" href="https://osf.io/amn8x/register/565fb3678c5e4a66b5582f67">preregistered</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;our predictions and methodology with the Open Science Framework, but didn&rsquo;t specify how we would conduct exploratory analysis.</span></p><p class="c0 c1 c15"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span>The sample provider Ipsos used survey quotas to balance data according to age, gender, region, race/ethnicity, and income.
