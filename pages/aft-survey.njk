We grant the Open Data badge based on two criteria: the published article (1) provides the URL, DOI, or other permanent path for accessing the data in a public, open access repository, and (2) contains sufficient information for an independent researcher to reproduce the reported results, though we do not conduct a full replication ourselves.</div>
